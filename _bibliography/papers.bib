	abstract = {The functions of many proteins are regulated through allostery, whereby effector binding at a distal site changes the functional activity (e.g., substrate binding affinity or catalytic efficiency) at the active site. Most allosteric studies have focused on thermodynamic properties, in particular, substrate binding affinity. Changes in substrate binding affinity by allosteric effectors have generally been thought to be mediated by conformational transitions of the proteins or, alternatively, by changes in the broadness of the free energy basin of the protein conformational state without shifting the basin minimum position. When effector binding changes the free energy landscape of a protein in conformational space, the change affects not only thermodynamic properties but also dynamic properties, including the amplitudes of motions on different time scales and rates of conformational transitions. Here we assess the roles of conformational dynamics in allosteric regulation. Two cases are highlighted where NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation have been used as complementary approaches to identify residues possibly involved in allosteric communication. Perspectives on contentious issues, for example, the relationship between picosecond–nanosecond local and microsecond–millisecond conformational exchange dynamics, are presented.},

	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

To this end, enzymatic proximity labeling platforms are broadly applied for mapping the wider spatial relationships in subcellular architectures. However, technologies that can map microenvironments with higher precision have long been sought. Here, we describe a microenvironment-mapping platform that exploits photocatalytic carbene generation to selectively identify protein-protein interactions on cell membranes, an approach we term MicroMap (μMap). By using a photocatalyst-antibody conjugate to spatially localize carbene generation, we demonstrate selective labeling of antibody binding targets and their microenvironment protein neighbors. This technique identified the constituent proteins of the programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) microenvironment in live lymphocytes and selectively labeled within an immunosynaptic junction.},

	abstract = {DNA is an incredibly dense storage medium for digital data. However, computing on the stored information is expensive and slow, requiring rounds of sequencing, in silico computation, and DNA synthesis. Prior work on accessing and modifying data using DNA hybridization or enzymatic reactions had limited computation capabilities. Inspired by the computational power of “DNA strand displacement,” we augment DNA storage with “in-memory” molecular computation using strand displacement reactions to algorithmically modify data in a parallel manner. We show programs for binary counting and Turing universal cellular automaton Rule 110, the latter of which is, in principle, capable of implementing any computer algorithm. Information is stored in the nicks of DNA, and a secondary sequence-level encoding allows high-throughput sequencing-based readout. We conducted multiple rounds of computation on 4-bit data registers, as well as random access of data (selective access and erasure). We demonstrate that large strand displacement cascades with 244 distinct strand exchanges (sequential and in parallel) can use naturally occurring DNA sequence from M13 bacteriophage without stringent sequence design, which has the potential to improve the scale of computation and decrease cost. Our work merges DNA storage and DNA computing, setting the foundation of entirely molecular algorithms for parallel manipulation of digital information preserved in DNA.},

Strain-specific effects dominated the fitness costs of gene OE. We report global differences in the consequences of gene OE, independent of the amplified gene, as well as gene-specific effects that were dependent on the genetic background. Natural variation in the response to gene OE could be explained by several models, including strain-specific physiological differences, resource limitations, and regulatory sensitivities. This work provides new insight on how genetic background influences tolerance to gene amplification and the evolutionary trajectories accessible to different backgrounds.},

Here we describe a chemical proteomic screen that identified ten previously uncharacterized S. aureus serine hydrolases that mostly lack human homologs. We termed these enzymes fluorophosphonate-binding hydrolases (FphA–J). One hydrolase, FphB, can process short fatty acid esters, exhibits increased activity in response to host cell factors, is located predominantly on the bacterial cell surface in a subset of cells, and is concentrated in the division septum. Genetic disruption of fphB confirmed that the enzyme is dispensable for bacterial growth in culture but crucial for establishing infection in distinct sites in vivo. A selective small molecule inhibitor of FphB effectively reduced infectivity in vivo, suggesting that it may be a viable therapeutic target for the treatment or management of Staphylococcus infections.},

	abstract = {Acetoacetate decarboxylase (AADase) has long been cited as the prototypical example of the marked shifts in the pKa values of ionizable groups that can occur in an enzyme active site. In 1966, it was hypothesized that in AADase the origin of the large pKa perturbation (-4.5 log units) observed in the nucleophilic Lys 115 results from the proximity of Lys 116, marking the first proposal of microenvironment effects in enzymology. The electrostatic perturbation hypothesis has been demonstrated in a number of enzymes, but never for the enzyme that inspired its conception, owing to the lack of a three-dimensional structure. Here we present the X-ray crystal structures of AADase and of the enamine adduct with the substrate analogue 2,4-pentanedione. Surprisingly, the shift of the pKa of Lys 115 is not due to the proximity of Lys 116, the side chain of which is oriented away from the active site. Instead, Lys 116 participates in the structural anchoring of Lys 115 in a long, hydrophobic funnel provided by the novel fold of the enzyme. Thus, AADase perturbs the pKa of the nucleophile by means of a desolvation effect by placement of the side chain into the protein core while enforcing the proximity of polar residues, which facilitate decarboxylation through electrostatic and steric effects.},

Here, results from experimental and molecular modelling approaches are gathered to classify several classes of non-canonical amino acids according to their ability to induce specific secondary structures yielding different biological functions and improved stability. Regarding side-chain modifications, symmetrical and asymmetrical α,α-dialkyl glycines, Cα to Cα cyclized amino acids, proline analogues, β-substituted amino acids, and α,β-dehydro amino acids are some of the non-canonical representatives addressed. Backbone modifications were also examined, especially those that result in retro-inverso peptidomimetics and depsipeptides. All this knowledge has an important application in the field of peptidomimetics, which is in continuous progress and promises to deliver new biologically active molecules and new materials in the near future.},

The byproducts of enzymatic activities have been preserved as chemical and isotopic signatures in the geologic record. However, interpretations of these signatures are limited by the assumption that such enzymes have remained functionally conserved over billions of years of molecular evolution. By reconstructing ancient genetic sequences in conjunction with laboratory enzyme resurrection, preserved biogeochemical signatures can instead be related to experimentally constrained, ancestral enzymatic properties. We may thereby investigate instances within molecular evolutionary trajectories potentially tied to significant biogeochemical transitions evidenced in the geologic record. Here, we survey recent enzyme resurrection studies to provide a reasoned assessment of areas of success and common pitfalls relevant to ancient biogeochemical applications. We conclude by considering the Great Oxidation Event, which provides a constructive example of a significant biogeochemical transition that warrants investigation with ancestral enzyme resurrection. This event also serves to highlight the pitfalls of facile interpretation of paleophenotype models and data, as applied to two examples of enzymes that likely both influenced and were influenced by the rise of atmospheric oxygen – RuBisCO and nitrogenase.},

	abstract = {Analysis of proteins commonly requires the partition of their structure into regions such as the surface, interior, or interface. Despite the frequent use of such categorization, no consensus definition seems to exist. This study thus aims at providing a definition that is general, is simple to implement, and yields new biological insights. This analysis relies on 397, 196, and 701 protein structures from Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Homo sapiens, respectively, and the conclusions are consistent across all three species. A threshold of 25\% relative accessible surface area best segregates amino acids at the interior and at the surface. This value is further used to extend the core–rim model of protein–protein interfaces and to introduce a third region called support. Interface core, rim, and support regions contain similar numbers of residues on average, but core residues contribute over two-thirds of the contact surface. The amino acid composition of each region remains similar across different organisms and interface types. The interface core composition is intermediate between the surface and the interior, but the compositions of the support and the rim are virtually identical with those of the interior and the surface, respectively. The support and rim could thus “preexist” in proteins, and evolving a new interaction could require mutations to form an interface core only. Using the interface regions defined, it is shown through simulations that only two substitutions are necessary to shift the average composition of a  1000-Å2 surface patch involving ∼28 residues to that of an equivalent interface. This analysis and conclusions will help understand the notion of promiscuity in protein–protein interaction networks.},

Bridgham et al. have now physically reconstituted ancient versions of a regulatory protein (the glucocorticoid receptor) and dissected the structural constraints imposed on the evolution of their function (which hormone they bind) at atomic resolution. They find that amino acids that were essential in an ancestral protein become neutral in a more recent form, where they are then subject to erosion by genetic drift. This loss deprives natural selection of the necessary raw material with which to reverse the historical substitutions — they are no longer 'adaptive' as they were in the other direction.

	abstract = {How complicated is the relationship between a protein’s sequence and its function? High-order epistatic interactions among residues are thought to be pervasive, making a protein’s function difficult to predict or understand from its sequence. Most prior studies, however, used methods that misinterpret measurement errors, small local idiosyncracies around a designated wild-type sequence, and global nonlinearity in the sequence-function relationship as rampant high-order interactions. Here we present a simple new method to jointly estimate global nonlinearity and specific epistatic interactions across a protein’s genotype-phenotype map. Our reference-free approach calculates the effect of each amino acid state or combination by averaging over all genotypes that contain it relative to the global average. We show that this method is more accurate than any alternative approach and is robust to measurement error and partial sampling. We reanalyze 20 combinatorial mutagenesis experiments and find that main and pairwise effects, together with a simple form of global nonlinearity, account for a median of 96\% of total variance in the measured phenotype (and {\textgreater} 92\% in every case), and only a tiny fraction of genotypes are strongly affected by epistasis at third or higher orders. The genetic architecture is also sparse: the number of model terms required to explain the vast majority of phenotypic variance is smaller than the number of genotypes by many orders of magnitude. The sequence-function relationship in most proteins is therefore far simpler than previously thought, and new, more tractable experimental approaches, combined with reference-free analysis, may be sufficient to explain it in most cases.
Significance Statement It is widely thought that a protein’s function depends on complex interactions among amino acids. If so, it would be virtually impossible to predict the function of new variants, and understanding how proteins work genetically and biochemically would require huge combinatorial experiments. We show that prior studies overestimated complexity because they analyzed sequence-function relationships from the perspective of a single reference genotype and/or misinterpreted global phenotypic nonlinearities as complex amino acid interactions. By developing a new reference-free approach and using it to reanalyze 20 experimental datasets, we show that additive effects and pairwise interactions alone, along with a simple global nonlinearity, explain the vast majority of functional variation. Higher-order interactions are weak or rare, and a minuscule fraction of possible interactions shape each protein’s function. Our work reveals that protein sequence-function relationships are surprisingly simple and suggests new strategies that are far more tractable than the massive experiments currently used.},

It is thought that this strategy enables specific regulatory connections to be formed in gene networks between otherwise weakly interacting, low-specificity molecular components. Here, using synthetic gene circuits constructed in yeast, we find that high regulatory specificity can emerge from cooperative, multivalent interactions among artificial zinc-finger-based TFs. We show that circuits “wired” using the strategy of cooperative TF assembly are effectively insulated from aberrant misregulation of the host cell genome. As we demonstrate in experiments and mathematical models, this mechanism is sufficient to rescue circuit-driven fitness defects, resulting in genetic and functional stability of circuits in long-term continuous culture. Our naturally inspired approach offers a simple, generalizable means for building high-fidelity, evolutionarily robust gene circuits that can be scaled to a wide range of host organisms and applications.},

Low-power electronic readout circuits2 integrated into the device convert the light emitted by the encapsulated bacteria to a wireless signal. We demonstrate in vivo biosensor monitoring in the gastrointestinal tract of small and large animal models and the integration of all components into a sub-1.4 cm3 form factor that is compatible with ingestion and capable of supporting wireless communication. With this device, diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease could be diagnosed earlier than is currently possible, and disease progression could be more accurately tracked.

However, although substantial structural variation for orthologous proteins exists within and among major phylogenetic lineages, in striking contrast to patterns of gene structure and genome organization, there appears to be no correlation between the level of protein structural complexity and organismal complexity. In addition, there is no evidence that protein architectural differences are driven by lineage-specific differences in selective pressures. Here, it is suggested that variation in the multimeric states of proteins can readily arise from stochastic transitions resulting from the joint processes of mutation and random genetic drift, even in the face of constant directional selection for one particular protein architecture across all lineages. Under the proposed hypothesis, on a long evolutionary timescale, the numbers of transitions from monomers to dimers should approximate the numbers in the opposite direction and similarly for transitions between higher-order structures.},

The resultant theory demonstrates that the likelihoods of alternative pathways for the emergence of protein complexes depend strongly on the effective population size. Nonetheless, it is equally clear that further advancements in this area will require comparative studies on the fitness consequences of alternative monomeric and dimeric proteins.},

	abstract = {Most proteins assemble into multisubunit complexes1. The persistence of these complexes across evolutionary time is usually explained as the result of natural selection for functional properties that depend on multimerization, such as intersubunit allostery or the capacity to do mechanical work2. In many complexes, however, multimerization does not enable any known function3. An alternative explanation is that multimers could become entrenched if substitutions accumulate that are neutral in multimers but deleterious in monomers; purifying selection would then prevent reversion to the unassembled form, even if assembly per se does not enhance biological function3–7. Here we show that a hydrophobic mutational ratchet systematically entrenches molecular complexes. By applying ancestral protein reconstruction and biochemical assays to the evolution of steroid hormone receptors, we show that an ancient hydrophobic interface, conserved for hundreds of millions of years, is entrenched because exposure of this interface to solvent reduces protein stability and causes aggregation, even though the interface makes no detectable contribution to function. Using structural bioinformatics, we show that a universal mutational propensity drives sites that are buried in multimeric interfaces to accumulate hydrophobic substitutions to levels that are not tolerated in monomers. In a database of hundreds of families of multimers, most show signatures of long-term hydrophobic entrenchment. It is therefore likely that many protein complexes persist because a simple ratchet-like mechanism entrenches them across evolutionary time, even when they are functionally gratuitous.},

Changes in the substrate-optimized chaperonins increase the polarity of the folding cavity and alter the ATPase cycle. These findings reveal a surprising plasticity of GroEL/S, which can be exploited to aid folding of recombinant proteins. Our studies also reveal a conflict between specialization and generalization of chaperonins as increased GFP folding comes at the expense of the ability of GroEL/S to fold its natural substrates. This conflict and the nature of the ring structure may help explain the evolution of cellular chaperone systems.},

	abstract = {With the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA, a shift occurred in how biologists investigated questions surrounding cellular processes, such as protein synthesis. Instead of viewing biological activity through the lens of chemical reactions, this new field used biological information to gain a new profound view of how biological systems work. Molecular biologists asked new types of questions that would have been inconceivable to the older generation of researchers, such as how cellular machineries convert inherited biological information into functional molecules like proteins. This new focus on biological information also gave molecular biologists a way to link their findings to concepts developed by genetics and the modern synthesis. However, by the late 1960s this all changed. Elevated rates of mutation, unsustainable genetic loads, and high levels of variation in populations, challenged Darwinian evolution, a central tenant of the modern synthesis, where adaptation was the main driver of evolutionary change. Building on these findings, Motoo Kimura advanced the neutral theory of molecular evolution, which advocates that selection in multicellular eukaryotes is weak and that most genomic changes are neutral and due to random drift. This was further elaborated by Jack King and Thomas Jukes, in their paper “Non-Darwinian Evolution”, where they pointed out that the observed changes seen in proteins and the types of polymorphisms observed in populations only become understandable when we take into account biochemistry and Kimura’s new theory. Fifty years later, most molecular biologists remain unaware of these fundamental advances. Their adaptionist viewpoint fails to explain data collected from new powerful technologies which can detect exceedingly rare biochemical events. For example, high throughput sequencing routinely detects RNA transcripts being produced from almost the entire genome yet are present less than one copy per thousand cells and appear to lack any function. Molecular biologists must now reincorporate ideas from classical biochemistry and absorb modern concepts from molecular evolution, to craft a new lens through which they can evaluate the functionality of transcriptional units, and make sense of our messy, intricate, and complicated genome.},

But a growing body of evidence from biochemistry, protein engineering, and molecular evolution shows that naturally occurring proteins often exist at or near the genetic edge of multimerization, allostery, and even new folds, so just one or a few mutations can trigger acquisition of these properties. These sudden transitions can occur because many of the physical properties that underlie these features are present in simpler proteins as fortuitous by‐products of their architecture. Moreover, complex features of proteins can be encoded by huge arrays of sequences, so they are accessible from many different starting points via many possible paths.

	abstract = {Synthetic biology holds promise to revolutionize the life sciences and biomedicine via expansion of macromolecular diversity outside the natural chemical space. Use of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) via codon reassignment has found diverse applications in protein structure and interaction analysis, introduction of post-translational modifications, production of constrained peptides, antibody-drug conjugates, and novel enzymes. However, simultaneously encoding multiple ncAAs in vivo requires complex engineering and is sometimes restricted by the cell's poor uptake of ncAAs. In contrast the open nature of cell-free protein synthesis systems offers much greater freedom for manipulation and repurposing of the biosynthetic machinery by controlling the level and identity of translational components and reagents, and allows simultaneous incorporation of multiple ncAAs with non-canonical side chains and even backbones (N-methyl, D-, β-amino acids, α-hydroxy acids etc.). This review focuses on the two most used Escherichia coli-based cell-free protein synthesis systems; cell extract- and PURE-based systems. The former is a biological mixture with {\textgreater}500 proteins, while the latter consists of 38 individually purified biomolecules. We delineate compositions of these two systems and discuss their respective advantages and applications. Also, we dissect the translational components required for ncAA incorporation and compile lists of ncAAs that can be incorporated into polypeptides via different acylation approaches. We highlight the recent progress in using unnatural nucleobase pairs to increase the repertoire of orthogonal codons, as well as using tRNA-specific ribozymes for in situ acylation. We summarize advances in engineering of translational machinery such as tRNAs, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, elongation factors, and ribosomes to achieve efficient incorporation of structurally challenging ncAAs. We note that, many engineered components of biosynthetic machinery are developed for the use in vivo but are equally applicable to the in vitro systems. These are included in the review to provide a comprehensive overview for ncAA incorporation and offer new insights for the future development in cell-free systems. Finally, we highlight the exciting progress in the genomic engineering, resulting in E. coli strains free of amber and some redundant sense codons. These strains can be used for preparation of cell extracts offering multiple reassignment options.},

However, the energetics driving folding are invisible in these structures and remain largely unknown2. The hidden thermodynamics of folding can drive disease3,4, shape protein evolution5–7 and guide protein engineering8–10, and new approaches are needed to reveal these thermodynamics for every sequence and structure. Here we present cDNA display proteolysis, a method for measuring thermodynamic folding stability for up to 900,000 protein domains in a one-week experiment. From 1.8 million measurements in total, we curated a set of around 776,000 high-quality folding stabilities covering all single amino acid variants and selected double mutants of 331 natural and 148 de novo designed protein domains 40–72 amino acids in length. Using this extensive dataset, we quantified (1) environmental factors influencing amino acid fitness, (2) thermodynamic couplings (including unexpected interactions) between protein sites, and (3) the global divergence between evolutionary amino acid usage and protein folding stability. We also examined how our approach could identify stability determinants in designed proteins and evaluate design methods. The cDNA display proteolysis method is fast, accurate and uniquely scalable, and promises to reveal the quantitative rules for how amino acid sequences encode folding stability.},

Engineering swarming is an untapped opportunity to increase the scale and robustness of coordinated synthetic microbial systems. Here we engineer Proteus mirabilis, which natively forms centimeter-scale bullseye swarm patterns, to ‘write’ external inputs into visible spatial records. Specifically, we engineer tunable expression of swarming-related genes that modify pattern features, and we develop quantitative approaches to decoding. Next, we develop a dual-input system that modulates two swarming-related genes simultaneously, and we separately show that growing colonies can record dynamic environmental changes. We decode the resulting multicondition patterns with deep classification and segmentation models. Finally, we engineer a strain that records the presence of aqueous copper. This work creates an approach for building macroscale bacterial recorders, expanding the framework for engineering emergent microbial behaviors.},

	abstract = {Measuring the mechanical properties of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is a challenge that has been addressed by different methods lately. The short persistence length, fragile structure, and the appearance of stem loops complicate the measurement, and this leads to a large variability in the measured values. Here we describe an innovative method based on DNA origami for studying the biophysical properties of ssDNA. By synthesizing a DNA origami structure that consists of two rigid rods with an ssDNA segment between them, we developed a method to characterize the effective persistence length of a random-sequence ssDNA while allowing the formation of stem loops. We imaged the structure with an atomic force microscope (AFM); the rigid rods provide a means for the exact identification of the ssDNA ends. This leads to an accurate determination of the end-to-end distance of each ssDNA segment, and by fitting the measured distribution to the ideal chain polymer model we measured an effective persistence length of 1.98 ± 0.72 nm. This method enables one to measure short or long strands of ssDNA, and it can cope with the formation of stem loops that are often formed along ssDNA. We envision that this method can be used for measuring stem loops for determining the effect of repetitive nucleotide sequences and environmental conditions on the mechanical properties of ssDNA and the effect of interacting proteins with ssDNA. We further noted that the method can be extended to nanoprobes for measuring the interactions of specific DNA sequences, because the DNA origami rods (or similar structures) can hold multiple fluorescent probes that can be easily detected.},

	abstract = {Cells have evolved a sophisticated proteostasis network to ensure that proteins acquire and retain their native structure and function. Critical components of this network include molecular chaperones and protein disaggregases, which function to prevent and reverse deleterious protein misfolding. Nevertheless, proteostasis networks have limits, which when exceeded can have fatal consequences as in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A promising strategy is to engineer proteostasis networks to counter challenges presented by specific diseases or specific proteins. Here, we review efforts to enhance the activity of individual molecular chaperones or protein disaggregases via engineering and directed evolution. Remarkably, enhanced global activity or altered substrate specificity of various molecular chaperones, including GroEL, Hsp70, ClpX, and Spy, can be achieved by minor changes in primary sequence and often a single missense mutation. Likewise, small changes in the primary sequence of Hsp104 yield potentiated protein disaggregases that reverse the aggregation and buffer toxicity of various neurodegenerative disease proteins, including α-synuclein, TDP-43, and FUS. Collectively, these advances have revealed key mechanistic and functional insights into chaperone and disaggregase biology. They also suggest that enhanced chaperones and disaggregases could have important applications in treating human disease as well as in the purification of valuable proteins in the pharmaceutical sector.},

	abstract = {Massively parallel genetic screens have been used to map sequence-to-function relationships for a variety of genetic elements. However, because these approaches only interrogate short sequences, it remains challenging to perform high throughput (HT) assays on constructs containing combinations of multiple sequence elements arranged across multikb length scales. Overcoming this barrier could accelerate synthetic biology; by screening diverse gene circuit designs, “composition-to-function” mappings could be created that reveal genetic part composability rules and enable rapid identification of behavior-optimized variants. Here, we introduce CLASSIC, a genetic screening platform that combines long– and short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS) modalities to quantitatively assess pools of constructs of arbitrary length containing diverse part compositions. We show that CLASSIC can measure expression profiles of {\textgreater}105 drug-inducible gene circuit designs (from 6-9 kb) in a single experiment in human cells. Using statistical inference and machine learning (ML) approaches, we demonstrate that data obtained with CLASSIC enables accurate predictive modeling of an entire circuit design landscape, offering critical insight into underlying design principles. Our work shows that by expanding the throughput and understanding gained with each design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle, CLASSIC dramatically augments the pace and scale of synthetic biology and establishes an experimental basis for data-driven design of complex genetic systems.},

	abstract = {The structure, function, and evolution of proteins depend on physical and genetic interactions among amino acids. Recent studies have used new strategies to explore the prevalence, biochemical mechanisms, and evolutionary implications of these interactions—called epistasis—within proteins. Here we describe an emerging picture of pervasive epistasis in which the physical and biological effects of mutations change over the course of evolution in a lineage-specific fashion. Epistasis can restrict the trajectories available to an evolving protein or open new paths to sequences and functions that would otherwise have been inaccessible. We describe two broad classes of epistatic interactions, which arise from different physical mechanisms and have different effects on evolutionary processes. Specific epistasis—in which one mutation influences the phenotypic effect of few other mutations—is caused by direct and indirect physical interactions between mutations, which nonadditively change the protein's physical properties, such as conformation, stability, or affinity for ligands. In contrast, nonspecific epistasis describes mutations that modify the effect of many others; these typically behave additively with respect to the physical properties of a protein but exhibit epistasis because of a nonlinear relationship between the physical properties and their biological effects, such as function or fitness. Both types of interaction are rampant, but specific epistasis has stronger effects on the rate and outcomes of evolution, because it imposes stricter constraints and modulates evolutionary potential more dramatically; it therefore makes evolution more contingent on low-probability historical events and leaves stronger marks on the sequences, structures, and functions of protein families.},

	abstract = {Across the Tree of Life (ToL), the complexity of proteomes varies widely. Our systematic analysis depicts that from the simplest archaea to mammals, the total number of proteins per proteome expanded ∼200-fold. Individual proteins also became larger, and multidomain proteins expanded ∼50-fold. Apart from duplication and divergence of existing proteins, completely new proteins were born. Along the ToL, the number of different folds expanded ∼5-fold and fold combinations ∼20-fold. Proteins prone to misfolding and aggregation, such as repeat and beta-rich proteins, proliferated ∼600-fold and, accordingly, proteins predicted as aggregation-prone became 6-fold more frequent in mammalian compared with bacterial proteomes. To control the quality of these expanding proteomes, core chaperones, ranging from heat shock proteins 20 (HSP20s) that prevent aggregation to HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP100 acting as adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-fueled unfolding and refolding machines, also evolved. However, these core chaperones were already available in prokaryotes, and they comprise ∼0.3\% of all genes from archaea to mammals. This challenge—roughly the same number of core chaperones supporting a massive expansion of proteomes—was met by 1) elevation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein abundances of the ancient generalist core chaperones in the cell, and 2) continuous emergence of new substrate-binding and nucleotide-exchange factor cochaperones that function cooperatively with core chaperones as a network.},

	abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coordinates viral RNA synthesis as part of an assembly known as the replication–transcription complex (RTC)1. Accordingly, the RTC is a target for clinically approved antiviral nucleoside analogues, including remdesivir2. Faithful synthesis of viral RNAs by the RTC requires recognition of the correct nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) for incorporation into the nascent RNA. To be effective inhibitors, antiviral nucleoside analogues must compete with the natural NTPs for incorporation. How the SARS-CoV-2 RTC discriminates between the natural NTPs, and how antiviral nucleoside analogues compete, has not been discerned in detail. Here, we use cryogenic-electron microscopy to visualize the RTC bound to each of the natural NTPs in states poised for incorporation. Furthermore, we investigate the RTC with the active metabolite of remdesivir, remdesivir triphosphate (RDV-TP), highlighting the structural basis for the selective incorporation of RDV-TP over its natural counterpart adenosine triphosphate3,4. Our results explain the suite of interactions required for NTP recognition, informing the rational design of antivirals. Our analysis also yields insights into nucleotide recognition by the nsp12 NiRAN (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase), an enigmatic catalytic domain essential for viral propagation5. The NiRAN selectively binds guanosine triphosphate, strengthening proposals for the role of this domain in the formation of the 5′ RNA cap6.},

We applied FuncLib to two unrelated enzymes, a phosphotriesterase and an acetyl-CoA synthetase. All designs were active, and most showed activity profiles that significantly differed from the wild-type and from one another. Several dozen designs with only 3–6 active-site mutations exhibited 10- to 4,000-fold higher efficiencies with a range of alternative substrates, including hydrolysis of the toxic organophosphate nerve agents soman and cyclosarin and synthesis of butyryl-CoA. FuncLib is implemented as a web server (http://FuncLib.weizmann.ac.il); it circumvents iterative, high-throughput experimental screens and opens the way to designing highly efficient and diverse catalytic repertoires.},

Bacterial allosteric transcription factors (aTFs) are a major class of regulatory proteins, but few aTFs have been redesigned to respond to new effectors beyond natural aTF-inducer pairs. Altering inducer specificity in these proteins is difficult because substitutions that affect inducer binding may also disrupt allostery. We engineered an aTF, the Escherichia coli lac repressor, LacI, to respond to one of four new inducer molecules: fucose, gentiobiose, lactitol or sucralose. Using computational protein design, single-residue saturation mutagenesis or random mutagenesis, along with multiplex assembly, we identified new variants comparable in specificity and induction to wild-type LacI with its inducer, isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The ability to create designer aTFs will enable applications including dynamic control of cell metabolism, cell biology and synthetic gene circuits.},

Our approach leverages high-throughput microfluidic screening to analyze hundreds of thousands of caspase variants in tightly controlled in vitro reactions. The resulting data provides a large-scale and unbiased view of the impact of amino acid substitutions on the proteolytic activity of CASP3 and CASP7. We use this data to pinpoint key functional differences between CASP3 and CASP7, including a secondary internal cleavage site, CASP7 Q196 that is not present in CASP3.

We present a supervised deep learning framework to learn the sequence–function mapping from deep mutational scanning data and make predictions for new, uncharacterized sequence variants. We test multiple neural network architectures, including a graph convolutional network that incorporates protein structure, to explore how a network’s internal representation affects its ability to learn the sequence–function mapping. Our supervised learning approach displays superior performance over physics-based and unsupervised prediction methods. We find that networks that capture nonlinear interactions and share parameters across sequence positions are important for learning the relationship between sequence and function. Further analysis of the trained models reveals the networks’ ability to learn biologically meaningful information about protein structure and mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate the models’ ability to navigate sequence space and design new proteins beyond the training set. We applied the protein G B1 domain (GB1) models to design a sequence that binds to immunoglobulin G with substantially higher affinity than wild-type GB1.},

We develop a statistical learning framework that models the evolutionary process and can infer the protein fitness landscape from multiple snapshots along an evolutionary trajectory. We apply our modeling approach to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) laboratory evolution data and the resulting landscape parameters capture important aspects of DHFR structure and function. We use the resulting model to understand the structure of the fitness landscape and find numerous examples of epistasis but an overall global peak that is evolutionarily accessible from most starting sequences.

Evolved TadA cytidine deaminases contain mutations at DNA-binding residues that alter enzyme selectivity to strongly favor deoxycytidine over deoxyadenosine deamination. Compared to commonly used CBEs, TadA-derived cytosine base editors (TadCBEs) offer similar or higher on-target activity, smaller size and substantially lower Cas-independent DNA and RNA off-target editing activity. We also identified a TadA dual base editor (TadDE) that performs equally efficient cytosine and adenine base editing. TadCBEs support single or multiplexed base editing at therapeutically relevant genomic loci in primary human T cells and primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

	abstract = {Living systems can generate an enormous range of cellular functions, from mechanical infrastructure and signalling networks to enzymatic catalysis and information storage, using a notably limited set of chemical functional groups. This observation is especially notable when compared to the breadth of functional groups used as the basis for similar functions in synthetically derived small molecules and materials. The relatively small cross-section between biological and synthetic reactivity space forms the foundation for the development of bioorthogonal chemistry, in which the absence of a pair of reactive functional groups within the cell allows for a selective in situ reaction1–4. However, biologically ‘rare’ functional groups, such as the fluoro5, chloro6,7, bromo7,8, phosphonate9, enediyne10,11, cyano12, diazo13, alkene14 and alkyne15–17 groups, continue to be discovered in natural products made by plants, fungi and microorganisms, which offers a potential route to genetically encode the endogenous biosynthesis of bioorthogonal reagents within living organisms. In particular, the terminal alkyne has found broad utility via the Cu(i)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition ‘click’ reaction18. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a unique pathway to produce a terminal alkyne-containing amino acid in the bacterium Streptomyces cattleya. We found that l-lysine undergoes an unexpected reaction sequence that includes halogenation, oxidative C–C bond cleavage and triple bond formation through a putative allene intermediate. This pathway offers the potential for de novo cellular production of halo-, alkene- and alkyne-labelled proteins and natural products from glucose for a variety of downstream applications.},

Here, we report a strategy to expand the palette of enzymatic halogenation by engineering a reaction pathway rather than substrate selectivity. This approach could allow us to tap the broader class of FeII/αKG-dependent hydroxylases as catalysts by their conversion to halogenases. Toward this goal, we discovered active halogenases from a DNA shuffle library generated from a halogenase–hydroxylase pair using a high-throughput in vivo fluorescent screen coupled to an alkyne-producing biosynthetic pathway. Insights from sequencing halogenation-active variants along with the crystal structure of the hydroxylase enabled engineering of a hydroxylase to perform halogenation with comparable activity and higher selectivity than the wild-type halogenase, showcasing the potential of harnessing hydroxylases for biocatalytic halogenation.},

Here we report a highly modular, PPI-dependent transcriptional activator, cCadC, that was designed to be compatible with homomeric interactions. We describe the process of engineering cCadC from a transmembrane protein into a soluble cytosolic regulator. We then show that gene transcription by cCadC can be controlled by homomeric PPIs and furthermore discriminates between dimeric and higher-order interactions. Finally, we demonstrate that cCadC activity can be placed under small molecule regulation using chemically induced dimerization or ligand dependent stabilization. This work should greatly expand the scope of PPIs that can be employed in artificial gene circuits in E. coli and complements the existing repertoire of tools for transcriptional regulation in synthetic biology.},

But Popper’s “critical rationalist” framework too is problematic. It has been accused of being: inconsistent on philosophical grounds; unworkable for modern “large science,” such as systems biology; inconsistent with the actual goals of experimental science, which is verification and not falsification; and harmful to the process of discovery as a practical matter. A criticism of the hypothesis as a framework for experimentation is offered.

Here, we systematically dissect the functional role of every residue in the tip domain of T7 phage RBP (1660 variants) by developing a high-throughput, locus-specific, phage engineering method. This rich dataset allowed us to cross compare functional profiles across hosts to precisely identify regions of functional importance, many of which were previously unknown. Substitution patterns showed host-specific differences in position and physicochemical properties of mutations, revealing molecular adaptation to individual hosts. We discovered gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constricting variants that eliminated certain hosts. To demonstrate therapeutic utility, we engineered highly active T7 variants against a urinary tract pathogen. Our approach presents a generalized framework for characterizing sequence–function relationships in many phage–bacterial systems.
          , 
            
              Bacteria can cause diseases, but they also battle their own microscopic enemies: a group of viruses known as bacteriophages. For instance, the T7 bacteriophage preys on various strains of
              Escherichia coli
              , a type of bacteria often found in the human gut. While many
              E. coli
              strains are inoffensive or even beneficial to human health, some can be deadly. Finding a way to kill harmful strains while sparing the helpful ones would be a helpful addition to the medicine toolkit.
            
            
              Bacteriophages identify and interact with their specific target through a structure known as the receptor binding protein, or RBP. However, it is still unclear exactly how RBP helps the viruses recognize which type of bacteria to infect. Here, Huss et al. set to map out and modify this structure in T7 bacteriophage so the virus is more efficient and specific about which strain of
              E. coli
              it kills.
            
            
              First, the role of each building block in the tip of RBP was meticulously dissected; this generated the knowledge required to genetically engineer a large number of different T7 bacteriophages, each with a slightly variation in their RBP. These viruses were then exposed to various strains of bacteria. Monitoring the bacteriophages that survived and multiplied the most after infecting different strains of
              E. coli
              revealed which RBP building blocks are important for efficiency and specificity. This was then confirmed by engineering highly active T7 bacteriophage variants against an
              E. coli
              strain that causes urinary tract infections.
            
            These findings demonstrate that even small changes to the bacteriophages can make a big difference to their ability to infect their preys. The approaches developed by Huss et al. help to understand exactly how the RBP allows a virus to infect a specific type of bacteria; this could one day pave the way for new therapies that harness those viruses to fight increasingly resistant bacterial infections.},

Smooth landscapes arise when incremental mutational steps lead to a progressive change in function, as commonly seen in enzymes and binding proteins. On the other hand, rugged landscapes are poorly understood because of the inherent unpredictability of how sequence changes affect function. Here, we experimentally characterize the entire sequence phylogeny, comprising 1158 extant and ancestral sequences, of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the LacI/GalR transcriptional repressor family. Our analysis revealed an extremely rugged landscape with rapid switching of specificity even between adjacent nodes. Further, the ruggedness arises due to the necessity of the repressor to simultaneously evolve specificity for asymmetric operators and disfavors potentially adverse regulatory crosstalk. Our study provides fundamental insight into evolutionary, molecular, and biophysical rules of genetic regulation through the lens of fitness landscapes.},

These orthogonal sigma-70s were engineered by screening a pooled library of computationally-guided designs customized toward each promoter target. A combination of conserved interactions with the DNA backbone and target-specific interactions facilitate new promoter recognition. Activity of the top performing redesigned sigma-70s varied across the promoter targets and ranged from 17\% to 77\% of native sigma-70 on its canonical active promoter.

Specifically, recent deep mutational scanning study showed that allosteric hotspots in the tetracycline repressor (TetR) and its homologous transcriptional factors (TFs) are broadly distributed rather than spanning well-defined structural pathways as often assumed. Moreover, the loss of allostery due to mutations of the hotspots was rescued by distributed additional mutations in a degenerate fashion. To gain a physical understanding of these intriguing observations, we develop a two-domain thermo-dynamic model for TetR, in which the protein is generically divided into ligand- and DNA-binding domains. The model incorporates three biophysical parameters to capture the intra- and inter-domain properties of TetR, and readily rationalizes the distributed network of allosterically coupled residues. Furthermore, we establish a quantitative connection between the model and the in vivo expression level of the TetR-regulated gene, which allows the extraction of the biophysical parameters in diverse mutants based on experimental induction curves using statistical inference. The quantitative mapping of the mutants to the model parameter space reveals the intrinsic connection between intra- and inter-domain allosteric parameters and also enables the evaluation of epistasis between the characterized mutations. The insights gained from this study into the nature of two-domain allostery are expected to have broader implications for other multidomain allosteric proteins.},

Ligand binding induces conformational changes in nuclear receptors and promotes their association with a diverse group of nuclear proteins, including SRC-1/p160 (3-5), TIF-2/GRIP-1 (refs 6, 7) and CBP/p300 (refs 4, 5, 8, 9) which function as co-activators of transcription, and RIP-140 (ref. 10), TIF-1 (ref. 11) and TRIP-1/SUG-1 (refs 12, 13) whose functions are unclear. Here we report that a short sequence motif LXXLL (where L is leucine and X is any amino acid) present in RIP-140, SRC-1 and CBP is necessary and sufficient to mediate the binding of these proteins to liganded nuclear receptors. We show that the ability of SRC-1 to bind the oestrogen receptor and enhance its transcriptional activity is dependent upon the integrity of the LXXLL motifs and on key hydrophobic residues in a conserved helix (helix 12) of the oestrogen receptor that are required for its ligand-induced activation function14. We propose that the LXXLL motif is a signature sequence that facilitates the interaction of different proteins with nuclear receptors, and is thus a defining feature of a new family of nuclear proteins.},

We show that {\textgreater}94\% of all mutational and epistatic effects appear highly idiosyncratic, which greatly distorted the functional prediction of the evolved enzymes.

The actions of these small lipophilic molecules are mediated by intracellular receptor proteins. It is just over 25 yr since the first cDNA for steroid receptors were cloned, a development that led to the birth of a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors: the nuclear receptors. The receptor proteins share structurally and functionally related ligand binding and DNA-binding domains but possess distinct N-terminal domains and hinge regions that are intrinsically disordered. Since the original cloning experiments, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the structure, mechanisms of action, and biology of this important class of ligand-activated transcription factors. In recent years, there has been interest in the structural plasticity and function of the N-terminal domain of steroid hormone receptors and in the allosteric regulation of protein folding and function in response to hormone, DNA response element architecture, and coregulatory protein binding partners. The N-terminal domain can exist as an ensemble of conformers, having more or less structure, which prime this region of the receptor to rapidly respond to changes in the intracellular environment through hormone binding and posttranslation modifications. In this review, we address the question of receptor structure and function dynamics with particular emphasis on the structurally flexible N-terminal domain, intra- and interdomain communications, and the allosteric regulation of receptor action.},

We assessed the ability of the ER to activate transcription of reporter plasmids containing either the consensus vitellogenin A2 ERE or the imperfect pS2, vitellogenin B1, or oxytocin (OT) ERE. The A2 ERE was the most potent activator of transcription. The OT ERE was significantly more effective in activating transcription than either the pS2 or B1 ERE. In deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) footprinting experiments, MCF-7 proteins protected A2 and OT EREs more effectively than the pS2 and B1 EREs. Limited protease digestion of the A2, pS2, B1, or OT ERE-bound receptor with V8 protease or proteinase K produced distinct cleavage products demonstrating that individual ERE sequences induce specific changes in ER conformation. Receptor interaction domains of glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 and steroid receptor coactivator 1 bound effectively to the A2, pS2, B1, and OT ERE-bound receptor and significantly stabilized the receptor-DNA interaction. Similar levels of the full-length p160 protein amplified in breast cancer 1 were recruited from HeLa nuclear extracts by the A2, pS2, B1, and OT ERE-bound receptors. In contrast, significantly less transcriptional intermediary factor 2 was recruited by the B1 ERE-bound receptor than by the A2 ERE-bound receptor.

	abstract = {Mutations in the estrogen receptor (ESR1) gene are common in ER-positive breast cancer patients who progress on endocrine therapies. Most mutations localise to just three residues at, or near, the C-terminal helix 12 of the hormone binding domain, at leucine-536, tyrosine-537 and aspartate-538. To investigate these mutations, we have used CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome engineering to generate a comprehensive set of isogenic mutant breast cancer cell lines. Our results confirm that L536R, Y537C, Y537N, Y537S and D538G mutations confer estrogen-independent growth in breast cancer cells. Growth assays show mutation-specific reductions in sensitivities to drugs representing three classes of clinical anti-estrogens. These differential mutation- and drug-selectivity profiles have implications for treatment choices following clinical emergence of ER mutations. Our results further suggest that mutant expression levels may be determinants of the degree of resistance to some anti-estrogens. Differential gene expression analysis demonstrates up-regulation of estrogen-responsive genes, as expected, but also reveals that enrichment for interferon-regulated gene expression is a common feature of all mutations. Finally, a new gene signature developed from the gene expression profiles in ER mutant cells predicts clinical response in breast cancer patients with ER mutations.},

An important reason for this is the lack of methods to comprehensively quantify allostery in diverse proteins. Here we address this shortcoming and present a method that uses deep mutational scanning to globally map allostery. The approach uses an efficient experimental design to infer en masse the causal biophysical effects of mutations by quantifying multiple molecular phenotypes—here we examine binding and protein abundance—in multiple genetic backgrounds and fitting thermodynamic models using neural networks. We apply the approach to two of the most common protein interaction domains found in humans, an SH3 domain and a PDZ domain, to produce comprehensive atlases of allosteric communication. Allosteric mutations are abundant, with a large mutational target space of network-altering ‘edgetic’ variants. Mutations are more likely to be allosteric closer to binding interfaces, at glycine residues and at specific residues connecting to an opposite surface within the PDZ domain. This general approach of quantifying mutational effects for multiple molecular phenotypes and in multiple genetic backgrounds should enable the energetic and allosteric landscapes of many proteins to be rapidly and comprehensively mapped.},

It affects {\textasciitilde}5–10\% of women in their reproductive years — translating to 176 million women worldwide — and is associated with pelvic pain and infertility. Diagnosis is reliably established only through surgical visualization with histological verification, although ovarian endometrioma and deep nodular forms of disease can be detected through ultrasonography and MRI. Retrograde menstruation is regarded as an important origin of the endometrial deposits, but other factors are involved, including a favourable endocrine and metabolic environment, epithelial–mesenchymal transition and altered immunity and inflammatory responses in genetically susceptible women. Current treatments are dictated by the primary indication (infertility or pelvic pain) and are limited to surgery and hormonal treatments and analgesics with many adverse effects that rarely provide long-term relief. Endometriosis substantially affects the quality of life of women and their families and imposes costs on society similar to those of other chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Future research must focus on understanding the pathogenesis, identifying disease subtypes, developing non-invasive diagnostic methods and targeting non-hormonal treatments that are acceptable to women who wish to conceive.},

Homodimerization or heterodimerization of TFs are required for DNA binding and the association interface between subunits, for the design of allosteric modulators, appears as a privileged structure for the pharmacophore-based computational strategy. Based on this strategy, a set of compounds were earlier identified as potential suppressors of OLIG2 dimerization and found to inhibit tumor growth in a mouse glioblastoma cell line and in a whole-animal study. To investigate whether the antitumor activity is due to the predicted mechanism of action, we undertook a study of OLIG2 dimerization using fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) of live HEK cells transfected with 2 spectrally different OLIG2 clones. The selected compounds showed an effect with potency, which correlated with the earlier observed antitumor activity. The OLIG2 proteins showed change in diffusion time under compound treatment in line with dissociation from DNA. The data suggest a general approach of drug discovery based on the design of allosteric modulators of protein–protein interaction.},

Although the imperfect vitellogenin B1, pS2, and oxytocin (OT) EREs each differ from the consensus vitellogenin A2 ERE sequence by a single base pair, ERβ activates transcription of reporter plasmids containing A2, pS2, B1, and OT EREs to different extents. To explain how these differences in transactivation might occur, we have examined the interaction of ERβ with these EREs and monitored recruitment of the coactivators amplified in breast cancer (AIB1) and transcription intermediary factor 2 (TIF2). Protease sensitivity, antibody interaction, and DNA pull-down assays demonstrated that ERβ undergoes ERE-dependent changes in conformation resulting in differential recruitment of AIB1 and TIF2 to the DNA-bound receptor. Overexpression of TIF2 or AIB1 in transient transfection assays differentially enhanced ERβ-mediated transcription of reporter plasmids containing the A2, pS2, B1, and OT EREs. Our studies demonstrate that individual ERE sequences induce changes in conformation of the DNA-bound receptor and influence coactivator recruitment. DNA-induced modulation of receptor conformation may contribute to the ability of ERβ to differentially activate transcription of genes containing divergent ERE sequences.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

By utilizing integrated complementary techniques of small-angle X-ray scattering, hydroxyl radical protein footprinting and computational modeling, here we report an asymmetric L-shaped “boot” structure of the multidomain hERα and identify the specific sites on each domain at the domain interface involved in DBD–LBD interactions. We demonstrate the functional role of the proposed DBD–LBD domain interface through site-specific mutagenesis altering the hERα interfacial structure and allosteric signaling. The L-shaped structure of hERα is a distinctive DBD–LBD organization of NR complexes and more importantly, reveals a signaling mechanism mediated by inter-domain crosstalk that regulates this receptor’s allosteric function.},

A particular emphasis of this review is on the chemical and structural diversity of an ever-increasing repertoire of physiological, environmental and synthetic ligands of estrogen receptors that ultimately modulate their interactions with cognate DNA located within the promoters of estrogen-responsive genes. In particular, modulation of estrogen receptors by small molecule ligands represents an important therapeutic goal toward the treatment of a wide variety of human pathologies including breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and obesity.

Here, we show that the application of PROSS server algorithms to the ligand-binding domain of human estrogen receptor alpha (hERα) enabled the development of variant ERPRS* that comprises 24 amino acid substitutions and exhibits multiple improved characteristics. The protein displays enhanced production rates in E. coli, crystallizes readily and its thermal stability is increased significantly by 23 °C. hERα is a nuclear receptor (NR) family member. In NRs, protein function is allosterically regulated by its interplay with small molecule effectors and the interaction with coregulatory proteins. The in-depth characterization of ERPRS* shows that these cooperative effects are fully preserved despite that 10\% of all residues were substituted. Crystal structures reveal several salient features, i.e. the introduction of a tyrosine corner in a helix-loop-helix segment and the formation of a novel surface salt bridge network possibly explaining the enhanced thermal stability. ERPRS* shows that prior successes in computational approaches for stabilizing proteins can be extended to proteins with complex allosteric regulatory behaviors as present in NRs. Since NRs including hERα are implicated in multiple diseases, our ERPRS* variant shows significant promise for facilitating the development of novel hERα modulators.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To set up an efficient gene editing system in Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) using CRISPR-Cas9 by demonstrating deletion of chromosomal and plasmid genes.
RESULTS: CRISPR-Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes was found to function in Bt cells, resulting in DNA cleavage that is lethal to the cells. The system was assessed for its ability to mediate gene editing by knock-out of the protease genes nprA (neutral protease A) and aprA (alkaline protease A). Gene editing was not detected when the Bacillus-derived pBCX was used to carry CRISPR-Cas9 elements and a DNA repair template. When the Cas9 promoter was replaced with the sporulation-specific promoter cyt2A, a Bt ∆nprA clone was obtained, but this plasmid construct did not give reproducible results. Bt ∆nprA ∆aprA and Bt ∆aprA deletion mutants were finally generated when the Lactobacillus plantarum-derived plasmid pLPPR9 was used, likely due to its lower copy number reducing Cas9 toxicity. Only three to four clones each needed to be screened to identify the desired gene-modified mutants. Conversely, efficient editing of the plasmid vip3A gene required the use of pBCX and longer homology sequences for the repair template.
CONCLUSIONS: Capitalizing on the differential impact of plasmid copy number and homology arm length, we devised distinct yet simple and efficient approaches to chromosomal and plasmid gene deletion for Bt that condense the screening process, minimize screening, and facilitate multiple consecutive gene editing steps.},

Functional studies in a defined genomic context show that sequence-induced changes in GR activity cannot be explained by differences in GR occupancy. Rather, mutating the dimerization interface mitigates DNA-induced changes in both activity and structure, arguing for a role of DNA-induced structural changes in modulating GR activity. Together, our study shows that DNA sequence identity of genomic binding sites modulates GR activity downstream of binding, which may play a role in achieving regulatory specificity towards individual target genes.},

Thus, the exploration of allosteric modulation is crucial for research on biological mechanisms and in the development of novel therapeutics. The development of small-molecule allosteric effectors can be used as tools to probe biological mechanisms of interest. One of the main limitations in targeting allosteric sites is the difficulty in uncovering them for specific receptors. Furthermore, upon discovery of novel allosteric modulation, early lead generation is made more difficult as compared to that at orthosteric sites because there is likely no information about the types of molecules that can bind at the site. In the work described here, we present a novel drug discovery pipeline, FASTDock, which allows one to uncover ligandable sites as well as small molecules that target the given site without requiring pre-existing knowledge of ligands that can bind in the targeted site. By using a hierarchical screening strategy, this method has the potential to enable high-throughput screens of an exceptionally large database of targeted ligand space.},

Tracing the evolution of enzyme activity and stability from the hot-start toward modern hyperthermophilic, mesophilic, and psychrophilic organisms illustrates active pressure versus passive drift in evolution on a molecular level, refutes the debated activity/stability trade-off, and suggests that the catalytic speed of adenylate kinase is an evolutionary driver for organismal fitness.},

These are the law of mass action, which holds that the binding of one molecule to another increases with concentration, and the fact that the colocalization of molecules vastly increases their local concentrations. It follows that colocalization can amplify the effect on one protein of random mutations in another protein and can therefore, through natural selection, lead to interactions between proteins and to a startling variety of complex allosteric controls. It also follows that allostery is common and that homologous proteins can have different allosteric mechanisms. Thus, the regulated protein networks of organisms seem to be the inevitable consequence of natural selection operating under physical laws.},

Consensus response elements have been delineated for the glucocorticoid, androgen, progesterone and mineralocorticoid receptors on one hand (steroid response element, SRE) and for the estrogen receptor on the other hand (estrogen response element, ERE). Small variations in these sequences not only affect the binding but may also have a dramatic impact on the transcriptional activity of steroid receptors. It has now become obvious that DNA response elements do not merely tether regulatory proteins to control regions of target genes but may additionally impart conformational changes onto the DNA-binding domain as well as to neighbouring domains of steroid receptors. This in turn will create unique platforms for selective recruitment of cofactors and possibly for induction of modifications in local chromatin architecture. An additional level of complexity is added by the frequent presence of multiple response elements in gene promoter regions. The allosteric effects of DNA response elements on steroid receptors may be essential for differential gene expression and this offers interesting perspectives for the identification of selective modulators.},

Traditionally, these binding sites have been viewed only as docking sites. Using structural, biochemical, and cell-based assays, we show that GR binding sequences, differing by as little as a single base pair, differentially affect GR conformation and regulatory activity. We therefore propose that DNA is a sequence-specific allosteric ligand of GR that tailors the activity of the receptor toward specific target genes.},

	abstract = {The binding of transcription factors to short recognition sequences plays a pivotal role in controlling the expression of genes. The sequence and shape characteristics of binding sites influence DNA binding specificity and have also been implicated in modulating the activity of transcription factors downstream of binding. To quantitatively assess the transcriptional activity of tens of thousands of designed synthetic sites in parallel, we developed a synthetic version of STARR-seq (synSTARR-seq). We used the approach to systematically analyze how variations in the recognition sequence of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) affect transcriptional regulation. Our approach resulted in the identification of a novel highly active functional GR binding sequence and revealed that sequence variation both within and flanking GR’s core binding site can modulate GR activity without apparent changes in DNA binding affinity. Notably, we found that the sequence composition of variants with similar activity profiles was highly diverse. In contrast, groups of variants with similar activity profiles showed specific DNA shape characteristics indicating that DNA shape may be a better predictor of activity than DNA sequence. Finally, using single cell experiments with individual enhancer variants, we obtained clues indicating that the architecture of the response element can independently tune expression mean and cell-to cell variability in gene expression (noise). Together, our studies establish synSTARR as a powerful method to systematically study how DNA sequence and shape modulate transcriptional output and noise.},

	abstract = {Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors with important roles in normal development and physiology and in a wide array of pathologies. While identification of natural or synthetic ligands for all human NRs has clarified their physiological roles and led to numerous therapeutic applications, much remains to be understood about the mechanisms by which NRs control transcription of specific networks of target genes. The DNA binding domain, composed of two C4 type zinc fingers, is the most conserved region in NRs. Binding motif selectivity stems from variations in dimerization interfaces in the DNA and ligand binding domains as well as from divergence in a few base-contacting residues in the first zinc finger. However, overlaps in DNA binding patterns suggest competition between different NRs at target sites in vivo, resulting in cross-regulation of subsets of target gene networks. As NRs can regulate transcription even when bound far from the transcription initiation sites of target genes, the considerable expansion in intergenic DNA in genomes throughout evolution likely contributes to the diversity and complexity of tissue-specific gene regulation by NRs. In particular, the presence of NR binding sites in the primate-specific Alu family of short-interspersed elements has been shown to confer transcriptional regulation by NRs to adjacent genes, although the impact on NR regulatory networks at the genome-wide scale remains to be more fully evaluated.},

In this review the general concept of allosteric modulation in drug discovery is first discussed, serving as a background and inspiration for NRs. Subsequently, the review focuses on examples of small molecules that allosterically modulate NRs, with a strong focus on structural information and the ligand binding domain. Recently discovered nanomolar potent allosteric site NR modulators are catapulting allosteric targeting of NRs to the center of attention.

We find more promiscuous NR-DNA binding than has been reported, challenging the view that NR binding specificity is defined by half-site spacing. We show that NRs bind DNA using two distinct modes, explaining widespread NR binding to half-sites in vivo. Finally, we show that the current models of NR specificity better reflect binding-site activity rather than binding-site affinity. Our rich dataset and revised NR binding models provide a framework for understanding NR regulatory specificity and will facilitate more accurate analyses of genomic datasets.},

	abstract = {A powerful and versatile system for the identification of novel response elements for members of the intracellular receptor family is presented as applied to the human estrogen receptor. In the past, a limited number of estrogen response elements (EREs) have been functionally identified in the promoter regions of estrogen-regulated genes. From these a consensus ERE has been defined that is identical to the ERE of the Xenopus laevis vitellogenin gene, i.e., 5'-GGTCA NNN TGACC-3'. In order to investigate without bias the range of sequences that could function as EREs in vivo, we have developed a genetic selection in yeast expressing the human estrogen receptor (hER) and transformed with a random oligonucleotide library in a vector where expression of a selectable marker requires insertion of an upstream activating sequence. More than 1,000,000 transformants were screened and of 726 clones that contained activating sequences, 65 were found to be hormone-dependent. Sequencing revealed that the majority contained at least one 4/5 match to a canonical ERE half-site, but only one contained a full consensus ERE as previously defined. Some contained half-sites arranged as direct repeats. Twelve elements were further characterized to compare estrogen activation in yeast and mammalian cells and in vitro binding to hER. The results of these studies reveal that sequences that bind weakly to hER in vitro are fully functional as EREs in yeast and are conditionally responsive to estrogen in mammalian cells. In addition, an element was identified that is more sensitive to the partial agonist activities of tamoxifen and nafoxidine than is the consensus ERE, indicating that not only promoter context but the sequence of the binding site itself can allow distinction between receptor activated by agonist and that activated by antagonist.},

One activator (Ste5-VWA) provides pathway insulation and dates to the divergence of Fus3 from its paralog, Kss1; a second activator (Ste5-FBD) that tunes mating behavior is, in contrast, not conserved in most lineages. Surprisingly, both Ste5 activator motifs could regulate MAP kinases that diverged from Fus3 prior to the emergence of Ste5, suggesting that Ste5 activators arose by exploiting latent regulatory features already present in the MAPK ancestor. The magnitude of this latent allosteric potential drifts widely among pre-Ste5 MAP kinases, providing a pool of hidden phenotypic diversity that, when revealed by new activators, could lead to functional divergence and to the evolution of distinct signaling behaviors.},

A two-layer framework derived from UniKP (EF-UniKP) has also been proposed to allow robust kcat prediction in considering environmental factors, including pH and temperature. In addition, four representative re-weighting methods are systematically explored to successfully reduce the prediction error in high-value prediction tasks. We have demonstrated the application of UniKP and EF-UniKP in several enzyme discovery and directed evolution tasks, leading to the identification of new enzymes and enzyme mutants with higher activity.

	abstract = {There are more ways to synthesize a 100 amino acid protein (20100) than atoms in the universe. Only a miniscule fraction of such a vast sequence space can ever be experimentally or computationally surveyed. Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to navigate high-dimensional sequence spaces. However, these models are extremely complicated and provide little insight into the fundamental genetic architecture of proteins. Here, by experimentally exploring sequence spaces {\textgreater}1010, we show that the genetic architecture of at least some proteins is remarkably simple, allowing accurate genetic prediction in high-dimensional sequence spaces with fully interpretable biophysical models. These models capture the non-linear relationships between free energies and phenotypes but otherwise consist of additive free energy changes with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. These energetic couplings are sparse and caused by structural contacts and backbone propagations. Our results suggest that artificial intelligence models may be vastly more complicated than the proteins that they are modeling and that protein genetics is actually both simple and intelligible.},

	abstract = {Gene products that are beneficial in one environment may become burdensome in another, prompting the emergence of diverse regulatory schemes that carry their own bioenergetic cost. By ensuring that regulators are only expressed when needed, we demonstrate that autoregulation generally offers an advantage in an environment combining mutation and time-varying selection. Whether positive or negative feedback emerges as dominant depends primarily on the demand for the target gene product, typically to ensure that the detrimental impact of inevitable mutations is minimized. While self-repression of the regulator curbs the spread of these loss-of-function mutations, self-activation instead facilitates their propagation. By analyzing the transcription network of multiple model organisms, we reveal that reduced bioenergetic cost may contribute to the preferential selection of autoregulation among transcription factors. Our results not only uncover how seemingly equivalent regulatory motifs have fundamentally different impact on population structure, growth dynamics, and evolutionary outcomes, but they can also be leveraged to promote the design of evolutionarily robust synthetic gene circuits.},

To gain insight into this process, we have combined molecular dynamics simulations with ancestral sequence reconstruction to explore conformational dynamics in two ancient steroid receptors (SRs) to determine how allosteric signaling pathways were altered over evolution to generate hormone specificity. In a broad panel of aromatized and non-aromatized hormones, we investigate inter-residue contacts that facilitate allosteric signaling. This work reveals interhelical interactions that act as ligand sensors and explain the structural and dynamical basis for ligand discrimination in SRs. These sensors are part of a conserved SR allosteric network and persist over long simulation time scales, indicating that evolutionary substitutions rewire ancient SR networks to achieve functional evolution. This powerful combination of computation, ancestral reconstruction, and biochemistry may illuminate allosteric mechanisms and functional evolution in other protein families.},

	abstract = {The glucocorticoid stress hormones affect brain function via high-affinity mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) and lower-affinity glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). MR and GR not only differ in affinity for ligands, but also have distinct, sometimes opposite, actions on neuronal excitability and other cellular and higher-order parameters related to cerebral function. GR and MR messenger RNA (mRNA) levels are often used as a proxy for the responsiveness to glucocorticoids, assuming proportionality between mRNA and protein levels. This may be especially relevant for the MR, which because of its high affinity is already largely occupied at low basal (trough) hormone levels. Here we explore how GR and MR mRNA levels are associated with the expression of a shared target gene, glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ, coded by Tsc22d3) with basal and elevated levels of corticosterone in male mice, using in situ hybridization. Depending on the hippocampal subfield and the corticosterone levels, mRNA levels of MR rather than GR mostly correlated with GILZ mRNA in the hippocampus and hypothalamus at the bulk tissue level. At the individual cell level, these correlations were much weaker. Using publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data, we again observed that MR and GR mRNA levels were only weakly correlated with target gene expression in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. We conclude that MR mRNA levels can be limiting for receptor action, but many other cell-specific and region-specific factors ultimately determine corticosteroid receptor action. Altogether, our results argue for caution while interpreting the consequences of changed receptor expression for the response to glucocorticoids.},

	abstract = {Hormone-activated ERs (ERα and ERβ) bind with high affinity to specific DNA sequences, estrogen response elements (EREs), located within the regulatory regions of target genes. Once considered to function solely as receptor tethers, there is an increasing amount of recent evidence to suggest that the sequence of the ERE can influence receptor activity. In this study, we have performed a systematic analysis of the role of different EREs in ER pharmacology. Specifically, by measuring ER activity on the vitellogenin A2, complement 3 gene, pS2, and lactoferrin EREs, we demonstrate that the activities of E2 and xenoestrogen ligands through ERα and ERβ are significantly influenced by the nature of the response element. Using a series of ERα and ERβ interacting peptides that contain the coactivator-binding motif LXXLL, we show that the type of ERE with which the receptor associates regulates the structure of the coactivator pocket on ER. Furthermore, using a novel ELISA developed to measure ER-coactivator interactions revealed that these different conformational states of ERα and ERβ are functionally relevant, as they dictate receptor coactivator binding preference. Together, these results indicate that the DNA response element is a key regulator of receptor structure and biological activity and suggest the ERE sequence influences the recruitment of coactivators to the ER at target gene promoters. We propose that DNA-induced alteration of protein structure and coregulator recruitment may serve as a universal regulatory component for differential gene expression by other nuclear hormone receptors and unrelated transcription factors.},

Increased knowledge on GC and GR biology together with a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the GC side effects and GCR are necessary for improved GC therapy development. We here provide a general overview on the current insights in GC biology with a focus on GC synthesis, regulation and physiology, role in inflammation inhibition, and on GR function and plasticity. Furthermore, novel and selective therapeutic strategies are proposed based on recently recognized distinct molecular mechanisms of the GR.

We propose that each of these signals acts as an allosteric effector that conveys gene, cell or physiological context information to GR by specifically altering its conformation.Integrated signal-driven conformational modifications of GR produce context-specific patterns of GR protein surfaces that are recognized by unique combinations of co-regulator proteins.GR, and perhaps many or all other TRFs, seems to lack intrinsic transcription regulatory activity and instead may be a molecular scaffold whose signal-driven structures nucleate the assembly of enzymatic machineries that confer distinct regulatory outcomes.Regulatory precision, signal-driven allostery and context-specified network plasticity are properties that are likely shared by most, if not all, metazoan TRFs.},

Like voltage-gated channels, TRPV1 exhibits four-fold symmetry around a central ion pathway formed by transmembrane segments 5–6 (S5–S6) and the intervening pore loop, which is flanked by S1–S4 voltage-sensor-like domains. TRPV1 has a wide extracellular ‘mouth’ with a short selectivity filter. The conserved ‘TRP domain’ interacts with the S4–S5 linker, consistent with its contribution to allosteric modulation. Subunit organization is facilitated by interactions among cytoplasmic domains, including amino-terminal ankyrin repeats.

	abstract = {Pathogenic microbes have evolved complex secretion systems to deliver virulence factors into host cells. Identification of these factors is critical for understanding the infection process. We report a powerful and versatile approach to the selective labeling and identification of secreted pathogen proteins. Selective labeling of microbial proteins is accomplished via translational incorporation of azidonorleucine (Anl), a methionine surrogate that requires a mutant form of the methionyl-tRNA synthetase for activation. Secreted pathogen proteins containing Anl can be tagged by azide-alkyne cycloaddition and enriched by affinity purification. Application of the method to analysis of the type III secretion system of the human pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica enabled efficient identification of secreted proteins, identification of distinct secretion profiles for intracellular and extracellular bacteria, and determination of the order of substrate injection into host cells. This approach should be widely useful for the identification of virulence factors in microbial pathogens and the development of potential new targets for antimicrobial therapy.},

Here we report on how an engineered minimal cell3,4 contends with the forces of evolution compared with the Mycoplasma mycoides non-minimal cell from which it was synthetically derived. Mutation rates were the highest among all reported bacteria, but were not affected by genome minimization. Genome streamlining was costly, leading to a decrease in fitness of greater than 50\%, but this deficit was regained during 2,000 generations of evolution. Despite selection acting on distinct genetic targets, increases in the maximum growth rate of the synthetic cells were comparable. Moreover, when performance was assessed by relative fitness, the minimal cell evolved 39\% faster than the non-minimal cell. The only apparent constraint involved the evolution of cell size. The size of the non-minimal cell increased by 80\%, whereas the minimal cell remained the same. This pattern reflected epistatic effects of mutations in ftsZ, which encodes a tubulin-homologue protein that regulates cell division and morphology5,6. Our findings demonstrate that natural selection can rapidly increase the fitness of one of the simplest autonomously growing organisms. Understanding how species with small genomes overcome evolutionary challenges provides critical insights into the persistence of host-associated endosymbionts, the stability of streamlined chassis for biotechnology and the targeted refinement of synthetically engineered cells2,7–9.},

Microbiome profiling of the biocomposite over multiple generations enabled the identification of a dominant bacterial component, Pantoea agglomerans, which was further isolated and developed into a new chassis. We introduced engineered P. agglomerans into native feedstocks to yield living blocks with new biosynthetic and sensing–reporting capabilities.

Westheimer and co-workers hypothesized that the pKa of Lys 115 is decreased by its spatial proximity to the ε-ammonium group of Lys 116. We have investigated this proposal by studying site-directed mutants of Lys 115 and Lys 116. Two substitutions for Lys 115 (K115C and K115Q) were both catalytically inactive at pH 5.95, the pH optimum of wild type AAD, demonstrating the importance of this residue in catalysis. Activity could be restored to K115C by aminoethylation with 2-bromoethylammonium bromide (2-BEAB). Substitutions for Lys 116 (K116C, K116N, and K116R) had reduced but significant activities at pH 5.95. The effects of Lys 116 on the pKa of Lys 115 in the mutant AADs were evaluated following imine formation with 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde and reduction with NaBH4. Whereas the pKa of Lys 115 in K116R is similar to that observed for wild type AAD, the pKas of Lys 115 in K116C and K116N were elevated to {\textgreater}9.2. Alkylation of Cys 116 in K116C with 2-BEAB resulted in both significant activation and restoration of the pKa of Lys 115 to 5.9. These data support Westheimer's hypothesis that the pKa of the Schiff base-forming Lys 115 is decreased by its spatial proximity to the ε-ammonium group of Lys 116.},

Here, we use phylogenetic deep mutational scanning to measure the functional effect of every possible amino acid mutation in a series of ancestral and extant steroid receptor DNA binding domains. Across 700 million years of evolution, epistatic interactions caused the effects of most mutations to become decorrelated from their initial effects and their windows of evolutionary accessibility to open and close transiently. Most effects changed gradually and without bias at rates that were largely constant across time, indicating a neutral process caused by many weak epistatic interactions. Our findings show that protein sequences drift inexorably into contingency and unpredictability, but that the process is statistically predictable, given sufficient phylogenetic and experimental data.},

We apply htFuncLib to the GFP chromophore-binding pocket, and, using fluorescence readout, recover {\textgreater}16,000 unique designs encoding as many as eight active-site mutations. Many designs exhibit substantial and useful diversity in functional thermostability (up to 96 °C), fluorescence lifetime, and quantum yield. By eliminating incompatible active-site mutations, htFuncLib generates a large diversity of functional sequences. We envision that htFuncLib will be used in one-shot optimization of activity in enzymes, binders, and other proteins.},

After duplication of the ancestral SR, three mutations in one copy radically weakened binding to the ancestral estrogen response element (ERE) and improved binding to a new set of DNA sequences (steroid response elements, SREs). They did so by establishing unfavorable interactions with ERE and abolishing unfavorable interactions with SRE; also required were numerous permissive substitutions, which nonspecifically improved cooperativity and affinity of DNA binding. Our findings indicate that negative determinants of binding play key roles in TFs’ DNA selectivity and—with our prior work on the evolution of SR ligand specificity during the same interval—show how a specific new gene regulatory module evolved without interfering with the integrity of the ancestral module.},

Additionally, one random protein, named Random antitoxin of MazF (RamF), modulated protein homeostasis by interacting with chaperones, leading to MazF proteolysis and a consequent loss of its toxicity. Finally, we demonstrate that random proteins can improve during evolution by identifying beneficial mutations that turned RamF into a more efficient inhibitor.

Despite the challenges, including low protein solubility and inclusion body formation, prokaryotic host systems and particularly Escherichia coli, remain the system of choice for the initial attempt of production of previously unexpressed proteins. Several different approaches have been adopted, including optimisation of growth conditions, expression in the periplasmic space of the bacterial host or co-expression of molecular chaperones, to assist correct protein folding. A very commonly employed approach is also the use of protein fusion tags that enhance protein solubility. Here, a range of experimentally tested peptide tags, which present specific advantages compared to protein fusion tags and the concluding remarks of these experiments are reviewed.

This robustness is thought to emerge from regulatory interactions in metabolic and genetic networks. Here, we explored the consequences of removing allosteric feedback inhibition in seven amino acid biosynthesis pathways in Escherichia coli (arginine, histidine, tryptophan, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, and proline). Proteome data revealed that enzyme levels decreased in five of the seven dysregulated pathways. Despite that, flux through the dysregulated pathways was not limited, indicating that enzyme levels are higher than absolutely needed in wild-type cells. We showed that such enzyme overabundance renders the arginine, histidine, and tryptophan pathways robust against perturbations of gene expression, using a metabolic model and CRISPR interference experiments.

Positional scanning synthetic combinatorial libraries revealed Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus protease to be highly specific, even at sites distal to the peptide bond undergoing hydrolysis. Specificity results were used to synthesize a hexapeptide diphenylphosphonate inhibitor of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus protease. The transition state analog inhibitors covalently phosphonylate the active site serine, freezing the enzyme structure during catalysis. An NMR-based assay was developed to monitor the native monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution and was used to demonstrate the effect of protease inhibition on the quaternary structure of the enzyme. NMR, circular dichroism, and size exclusion chromatography analysis showed that active site inhibition strongly regulates the binding affinity of the monomer-dimer equilibrium at the spatially separate dimer interface of the protease, shifting the equilibrium to the dimeric form of the enzyme. Furthermore, inhibitor studies revealed that the catalytic cycles of the spatially separate active sites are independent. These results (i) provide direct evidence that peptide bond hydrolysis is integrally linked to the quaternary structure of the enzyme, (ii) establish a molecular mechanism of protease activation and stabilization during catalysis, and (iii) highlight potential implications of substoichiometric inhibition of the viral protease in developing herpesviral therapeutics.},

The resulting landscape is highly rugged and harbors 514 fitness peaks. However, its highest peaks are accessible to evolving populations via abundant fitness-increasing paths. Different peaks share large basins of attraction that render the outcome of adaptive evolution highly contingent on chance events. Our work shows that ruggedness need not be an obstacle to Darwinian evolution but can reduce its predictability.

In this article, we investigate how the reverse-sequences of native proteins might fold by examining a series of small proteins of increasing structural complexity (α-helix, β-hairpin, α-helix bundle and α/β-protein). Employing a tandem protein structure prediction algorithmic and molecular dynamics simulation approach, we find that the ability of reverse sequences to adopt native-like folds is strongly influenced by protein size and the flexibility of the native hydrophobic core. For β-hairpins with reverse-sequences that fail to fold, we employ a simple mutational strategy for guiding stable hairpin formation that involves the insertion of amino acids into the β-turn region. This systematic look at reverse sequence duality sheds new light on the problem of protein sequence-structure mapping and may serve to inspire new protein design and protein structure prediction protocols.},

The orthogonal DNA replication system (OrthoRep) in yeast can efficiently mutate long DNA fragments in an easy-to-operate manner. However, such a system is lacking in bacteria. Therefore, we developed a bacterial orthogonal DNA replication system (BacORep) for continuous evolution. We achieved this by harnessing the temperate phage GIL16 DNA replication machinery in Bacillus thuringiensis with an engineered error-prone orthogonal DNA polymerase. BacORep introduces all 12 types of nucleotide substitution in 15-kilobase genes on orthogonally replicating linear plasmids with a 6,700-fold higher mutation rate than that of the host genome, the mutation rate of which is unchanged. Here we demonstrate the utility of BacORep-based continuous evolution by generating strong promoters applicable to model bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, and achieving a 7.4-fold methanol assimilation increase in B. thuringiensis. BacORep is a powerful tool for continuous evolution in prokaryotic cells.},

Using OrthoRep, we evolved drug-resistant malarial dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) in 90 independent replicates. We uncovered a more complex fitness landscape than previously realized, including common adaptive trajectories constrained by epistasis, rare outcomes that avoid a frequent early adaptive mutation, and a suboptimal fitness peak that occasionally traps evolving populations.

The activity of many natural enzymes is regulated by the binding of ligands that have different structures than their substrates; these ligands are consequently called allosteric effectors. In most allosteric enzymes, the allosteric binding site lies far away from the active site. This implies that communication pathways, must exist between these sites. While mechanisms of allosteric regulation were developed more than forty years ago, they continue to be revisited regularly. The improved understanding of these mechanisms has led in the past two decades to projects to transform several unregulated enzymes into allosterically regulated ones either by rational design or directed evolution techniques. More recently, ribozymes have also been the object of similar successful engineering efforts. in this., review, after briefly summarising recent progress in the theories of allosteric regulation, several strategies to engineer allosteric regulations in enzymes and ribozymes are described and compared. These redesigned biological catalysts find applications in a variety of areas.},

Here, we demonstrate that this CRISPR-associated protease (CASP) exhibits programmable RNA-activated endopeptidase activity against a sigma factor inhibitor to regulate a transcriptional response. Cryo–electron microscopy of an active and substrate-bound CASP complex reveals an allosteric activation mechanism that reorganizes Csx29 catalytic residues upon target RNA binding.

	abstract = {Predicting properties of proteins is of interest for basic biological understanding and protein engineering alike. Increasingly, machine learning (ML) approaches are being used for this task. However, the accuracy of such ML models typically degrades as test proteins stray further from the training data distribution. On the other hand, models that are more data-free, such as biophysics-based models, are typically uniformly accurate over all of the protein space, even if inferior for test points close to the training distribution. Consequently, being able to cohesively blend these two types of information within one model, as appropriate in different parts of the protein space, will improve overall importance. Herein, we tackle just this problem to yield a simple, practical, and scalable approach that can be easily implemented. In particular, we use a Bayesian formulation to integrate biophysical knowledge into neural networks. However, in doing so, a technical challenge arises: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) enable the user to specify prior information only on the neural network weight parameters, rather than on the function values given to us from a typical biophysics-based model. Consequently, we devise a principled probabilistic method to overcome this challenge. Our approach yields intuitively pleasing results: predictions rely more heavily on the biophysical prior information when the BNN epistemic uncertainty─uncertainty arising from a lack of training data rather than sensor noise─is large and more heavily on the neural network when the epistemic uncertainty is small. We demonstrate this approach on an illustrative synthetic example, on two examples of protein property prediction (fluorescence and binding), and for generality on one small molecule property prediction problem.},

	abstract = {How complicated is the relationship between a protein's sequence and its function? High-order epistatic interactions among residues are thought to be pervasive, making a protein's function difficult to predict or understand from its sequence. Most prior studies, however, used methods that misinterpret measurement errors, small local idiosyncracies around a designated wild-type sequence, and global nonlinearity in the sequence-function relationship as rampant high-order interactions. Here we present a simple new method to jointly estimate global nonlinearity and specific epistatic interactions across a protein's genotype-phenotype map. Our reference-free approach calculates the effect of each amino acid state or combination by averaging over all genotypes that contain it relative to the global average. We show that this method is more accurate than any alternative approach and is robust to measurement error and partial sampling. We reanalyze 20 combinatorial mutagenesis experiments and find that main and pairwise effects, together with a simple form of global nonlinearity, account for a median of 96\% of total variance in the measured phenotype (and {\textgreater} 92\% in every case), and only a tiny fraction of genotypes are strongly affected by epistasis at third or higher orders. The genetic architecture is also sparse: the number of model terms required to explain the vast majority of phenotypic variance is smaller than the number of genotypes by many orders of magnitude. The sequence-function relationship in most proteins is therefore far simpler than previously thought, and new, more tractable experimental approaches, combined with reference-free analysis, may be sufficient to explain it in most cases.},

Recent genomic studies revealed a surprisingly strong anticorrelation between the expression level of a protein and its rate of sequence evolution. This observation is currently explained by the translational robustness hypothesis in which the toxicity of translational error-induced protein misfolding selects for higher translational robustness of more abundant proteins, which constrains sequence evolution. However, the impact of error-free protein misfolding has not been evaluated. We estimate that a non-negligible fraction of misfolded proteins are error free and demonstrate by a molecular-level evolutionary simulation that selection against protein misfolding results in a greater reduction of error-free misfolding than error-induced misfolding. Thus, an overarching protein-misfolding-avoidance hypothesis that includes both sources of misfolding is superior to the translational robustness hypothesis. We show that misfolding-minimizing amino acids are preferentially used in highly abundant yeast proteins and that these residues are evolutionarily more conserved than other residues of the same proteins. These findings provide unambiguous support to the role of protein-misfolding-avoidance in determining the rate of protein sequence evolution.},

	abstract = {Protein evolvability includes two elements—robustness (or neutrality, mutations having no effect) and innovability (mutations readily inducing new functions). How are these two conflicting demands bridged? Does the ability to bridge them relate to the observation that certain folds, such as TIM barrels, accommodate numerous functions, whereas other folds support only one? Here, we hypothesize that the key to innovability is polarity—an active site composed of flexible, loosely packed loops alongside a well-separated, highly ordered scaffold. We show that highly stabilized variants of TEM-1 β-lactamase exhibit selective rigidification of the enzyme's scaffold while the active-site loops maintained their conformational plasticity. Polarity therefore results in stabilizing, compensatory mutations not trading off, but instead promoting the acquisition of new activities. Indeed, computational analysis indicates that in folds that accommodate only one function throughout evolution, for example, dihydrofolate reductase, ≥60\% of the active-site residues belong to the scaffold. In contrast, folds associated with multiple functions such as the TIM barrel show high scaffold–active-site polarity ({\textasciitilde}20\% of the active site comprises scaffold residues) and {\textgreater}2-fold higher rates of sequence divergence at active-site positions. Our work suggests structural measures of fold polarity that appear to be correlated with innovability, thereby providing new insights regarding protein evolution, design, and engineering.},

	abstract = {Genetically encoded biosensors are valuable for the optimization of small-molecule biosynthesis pathways, because they transduce the production of small-molecule ligands into a readout compatible with high-throughput screening or selection in vivo. However, engineering biosensors with appropriate response functions and ligand preferences remains challenging. Here, we show that the continuous hypermutation system, OrthoRep, can be effectively applied to evolve biosensors with a high dynamic range, reprogrammed activity toward desired noncognate ligands, and proper operational range for coupling to biosynthetic pathways. In particular, we encoded the allosteric transcriptional factor, BenM, on OrthoRep such that the propagation of host yeast cells resulted in BenM’s rapid and continuous diversification. When these cells were subjected to cycles of culturing and sorting on BenM activity in the presence and absence of its cognate ligand, muconic acid, or the noncognate ligand, adipic acid, we obtained multiple BenM variants that respond to their corresponding ligands. These biosensors outperform previously engineered BenM-based biosensors by achieving a substantially greater dynamic range (up to ∼180-fold induction) and broadened operational range. The expression of select BenM variants in the presence of a muconic acid biosynthetic pathway demonstrated sensitive biosensor activation without saturating response, which should enable pathway and host engineering for higher production of muconic and adipic acids. Given the streamlined manner in which high-performance and versatile biosensors were evolved using OrthoRep, this study provides a template for generating custom biosensors for metabolic pathway engineering and other biotechnology goals.},

Here, we highlight how the emergence of an expanded repertoire of amino acids has opened new avenues in enzyme design and engineering. ncAAs have been used to probe complex biological mechanisms, augment enzyme function and, most ambitiously, embed new catalytic mechanisms into protein active sites that would be challenging to access within the constraints of nature’s genetic code. We predict that the studies reviewed in this article, along with further advances in genetic code expansion technology, will establish ncAA incorporation as an increasingly important tool for biocatalysis in the coming years.},

Here, we extend deep-mutation technologies to enable measurement of many thousands of pairwise amino acid couplings in several homologs of a protein family – a deep coupling scan (DCS). The data show that cooperative interactions between residues are loaded in a sparse, evolutionarily conserved, spatially contiguous network of amino acids. The pattern of amino acid coupling is quantitatively captured in the coevolution of amino acid positions, especially as indicated by the statistical coupling analysis (SCA), providing experimental confirmation of the key tenets of this method. This work exposes the collective nature of physical constraints on protein function and clarifies its link with sequence analysis, enabling a general practical approach for understanding the structural basis for protein function.},

Here, we show that adaptation to a physiologically distinct class of ligand specificity in a PSD95, DLG1, ZO-1 (PDZ) domain preferentially occurs through class-bridging intermediate mutations located distant from the ligand-binding site. These mutations provide a functional link between ligand classes and demonstrate the principle of “conditional neutrality” in mediating evolutionary adaptation. Structures show that class-bridging mutations work allosterically to open up conformational plasticity at the active site, permitting novel functions while retaining existing function. More generally, the class-bridging phenotype arises from mutations in an evolutionarily conserved network of coevolving amino acids in the PDZ family (the sector) that connects the active site to distant surface sites. These findings introduce the concept that allostery in proteins could have its origins not in protein function but in the capacity to adapt.},

	abstract = {The ability to selectively activate function of particular proteins via pharmacological agents is a longstanding goal in chemical biology. Recently, we reported an approach for designing a de novo allosteric effector site directly into the catalytic domain of an enzyme. This approach is distinct from traditional chemical rescue of enzymes in that it relies on disruption and restoration of structure, rather than active site chemistry, as a means to achieve modulate function. However, rationally identifying analogous de novo binding sites in other enzymes represents a key challenge for extending this approach to introduce allosteric control into other enzymes. Here we show that mutation sites leading to protein inactivation via tryptophan-to-glycine substitution and allowing (partial) reactivation by the subsequent addition of indole are remarkably frequent. Through a suite of methods including a cell-based reporter assay, computational structure prediction and energetic analysis, fluorescence studies, enzymology, pulse proteolysis, X-ray crystallography, and hydrogen–deuterium mass spectrometry, we find that these switchable proteins are most commonly modulated indirectly, through control of protein stability. Addition of indole in these cases rescues activity not by reverting a discrete conformational change, as we had observed in the sole previously reported example, but rather rescues activity by restoring protein stability. This important finding will dramatically impact the design of future switches and sensors built by this approach, since evaluating stability differences associated with cavity-forming mutations is a far more tractable task than predicting allosteric conformational changes. By analogy to natural signaling systems, the insights from this study further raise the exciting prospect of modulating stability to design optimal recognition properties into future de novo switches and sensors built through chemical rescue of structure.},

	abstract = {Protein allostery is a biological process facilitated by spatially long-range intra-protein communication, whereby ligand binding or amino acid change at a distant site affects the active site remotely. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a powerful computational approach to probe the allosteric effect. However, current MD simulations cannot reach the time scales of whole allosteric processes. The advent of deep learning made it possible to evaluate both spatially short and long-range communications for understanding allostery. For this purpose, we applied a neural relational inference model based on a graph neural network, which adopts an encoder-decoder architecture to simultaneously infer latent interactions for probing protein allosteric processes as dynamic networks of interacting residues. From the MD trajectories, this model successfully learned the long-range interactions and pathways that can mediate the allosteric communications between distant sites in the Pin1, SOD1, and MEK1 systems. Furthermore, the model can discover allostery-related interactions earlier in the MD simulation trajectories and predict relative free energy changes upon mutations more accurately than other methods.},

	abstract = {Genes that drive the proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis of malignant cells have been identified for many human cancers1–4. Independent studies have identified cell death pathways that eliminate cells for the good of the organism5,6. The coexistence of cell death pathways with driver mutations suggests that the cancer driver could be rewired to activate cell death using chemical inducers of proximity (CIPs). Here we describe a new class of molecules called transcriptional/epigenetic CIPs (TCIPs) that recruit the endogenous cancer driver, or a downstream transcription factor, to the promoters of cell death genes, thereby activating their expression. We focused on diffuse large B cell lymphoma, in which the transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is deregulated7. BCL6 binds to the promoters of cell death genes and epigenetically suppresses their expression8. We produced TCIPs by covalently linking small molecules that bind BCL6 to those that bind to transcriptional activators that contribute to the oncogenic program, such as BRD4. The most potent molecule, TCIP1, increases binding of BRD4 by 50\% over genomic BCL6-binding sites to produce transcriptional elongation at pro-apoptotic target genes within 15 min, while reducing binding of BRD4 over enhancers by only 10\%, reflecting a gain-of-function mechanism. TCIP1 kills diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines, including chemotherapy-resistant, TP53-mutant lines, at EC50 of 1–10 nM in 72 h and exhibits cell-specific and tissue-specific effects, capturing the combinatorial specificity inherent to transcription. The TCIP concept also has therapeutic applications in regulating the expression of genes for regenerative medicine and developmental disorders.},

This is mainly due to difficulties in establishing proper size regimes and in the analytical quantification of colocalization effect with adequate experimental systems and simulations. In this study, by taking advantage of reversible DNA-directed colocalization of enzymes on microspheres, we established a cascade system that can be used to directly evaluate the colocalization effect with exactly the same experimental settings except for the state of enzyme dispersion. In the regime of highly dilute microspheres of particular sizes, the colocalized cascade shows enhanced activity compared with the freely diffusing cascade, as evidenced by a shortened lag phase in the time-course production. Reaction-diffusion modeling reveals that the enhancement can be ascribed to the initial accumulation of intermediate substrate around the colocalized enzymes and is found to be carrier-size-dependent. This work demonstrates the dependence of the colocalization effect of enzyme cascades on an interplay of nano- and microscales, lending theoretical support to the rational design of highly efficient multienzyme catalysts.},

In this Primer, we summarize the methodologies of DNA origami technology, including origami design, synthesis, functionalization and characterization. We highlight applications of origami structures in nanofabrication, nanophotonics and nanoelectronics, catalysis, computation, molecular machines, bioimaging, drug delivery and biophysics.

	abstract = {DNA origami has emerged in recent years as a powerful technique for designing and building 2D and 3D nanostructures. While the breadth of structures that have been produced is impressive, one of the remaining challenges, especially for DNA origami structures that are intended to carry out useful biomedical tasks in vivo, is to endow them with the ability to detect and respond to molecules of interest. Target molecules may be disease indicators or cell surface receptors, and the responses may include conformational changes leading to the release of therapeutically relevant cargo. Nucleic acid aptamers are ideally suited to this task and are beginning to be used in DNA origami designs. In this review, we consider examples of uses of DNA aptamers in DNA origami structures and summarise what is currently understood regarding aptamer-origami integration. We review three major roles for aptamers in such applications: protein immobilisation, triggering of structural transformation, and cell targeting. Finally, we consider future perspectives for DNA aptamer integration with DNA origami.},

Localized at the peri‐membrane, mitochondria, and the nucleus of cells that are dependent on estrogen target tissues, the ERs share similar, as well as distinct, regulatory potentials. Different intracellular localizations of the ERs result in dynamically integrated and finely tuned E2 signaling cascades that orchestrate cellular growth, differentiation, and death. The deregulation of E2–ER signaling plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of target tissue malignancies. A better understanding of the complex regulatory mechanisms that underlie ER actions in response to E2 therefore holds a critical trajectory for the development of novel prognostic and therapeutic approaches with substantial impacts on the systemic management of target tissue diseases.},

The capability to organize enzymes has taken many forms from more traditional 2D pairings on individual scaffolds to recent works introducing enzyme organizations in 3D lattices. As the ability to define nanoscale structure has grown, it is critical to fully deconstruct the impact of enzyme organization at the single-scaffold level. Here, we present an open, three-dimensional (3D) DNA wireframe octahedron which is used to create a library of spatially arranged organizations of glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase. We explore the contribution of enzyme spacing, arrangement, and location on the 3D scaffold to cascade activity. The experiments provide insight into enzyme scaffold design, including the insignificance of scaffold sequence makeup on activity, an increase in activity at small enzyme spacings of {\textless}10 nm, and activity changes that arise from discontinuities in scaffold architecture. Most notably, the experiments allow us to determine that enzyme colocalization itself on the DNA scaffold dominates over any specific enzyme arrangement.},

Here, we report the structural and functional characterization of an ERα-specific peptide that binds to the liganded receptor in an AF2-independent manner. The 2-Å crystal structure of the ER/peptide complex reveals a binding site that is centered on a shallow depression on the β-hairpin face of the ligand-binding domain. The peptide binds in an unusual extended conformation and makes multiple contacts with the ligand-binding domain. The location and architecture of the binding site provides an insight into the peptide's ER subtype specificity and ligand interaction preferences. In vivo, an engineered coactivator containing the peptide motif is able to strongly enhance the transcriptional activity of liganded ERα, particularly in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Furthermore, disruption of this binding surface alters ER's response to the coregulator TIF2. Together, these results indicate that this previously unknown interaction site represents a bona fide control surface involved in regulating receptor activity.},

ERs are converted from an inactive form to a transcriptionally active state through conformational changes induced by ligand and estrogen-responsive element (ERE) sequences. We show here that ERα and ERβ bind to an ERE independently from ER ligands. We found that although the binding affinity of ERβ for an ERE is 2-fold lower than that of ERα, both ERs use the same nucleotides for DNA contacts. We show that both EREs and ligands are independent modulators of ER conformation. Specifically, the ERE primarily determines the receptor-DNA affinity, whereas the structure of the ER ligand dictates the affinity of ER for particular cofactors. We found that the ligand-dependent cofactor transcriptional intermediary factor-2, through a distinct surface, also interacts with ERα preferentially and independently of ligand. The extent of interaction, however, is dependent upon the ER-ERE affinity. In transfected cells, ERα is more transcriptionally active than ERβ. The ERE sequence, however, determines the potency of gene induction when either ER subtype binds to an agonist. Antagonists prevent ERs from inducing transcription independently from ERE sequences. Thus, ERE- and ligand-induced structural changes are independent determinants for the recruitment of cofactors and transcriptional responses. The ability of ERα to differentially recruit a cofactor could contribute to ER subtype-specific gene responses.},

The intricate task of regulating gene expression in the many differentiated cell types of multicellular organisms is accomplished primarily by the combined actions of multiple different transcriptional regulatory proteins. In addition, the packaging of DNA into chromatin and its modification by methylation impart further levels of complexity to the control of eukaryotic gene expression.},

Here, we carried out a systematic comparison of eight commonly used constitutive promoters (SV40, CMV, UBC, EF1A, PGK and CAGG for mammalian systems, and COPIA and ACT5C for Drosophila systems). We also included in the comparison the TRE promoter, which can be activated by the rtTA transcriptional activator in a doxycycline-inducible manner. To make our findings representative, we conducted the comparison in a variety of cell types derived from several species. We found that these promoters vary considerably from one another in their strength. Most promoters have fairly consistent strengths across different cell types, but the CMV promoter can vary considerably from cell type to cell type. At maximal induction, the TRE promoter is comparable to a strong constitutive promoter. These results should facilitate more rational choices of promoters in ectopic gene expression studies.},

Moreover, most regulatory elements have borrowed genetic sequences from viral elements. Here, we generate a set of 10 rational and 30 synthetic terminators derived from nonviral elements and evaluate them in the HT1080 and HEK293 cell lines to demonstrate that they are comparable in terms of tuning gene expression/protein output to the viral SV40 element and often require less sequence footprint. The mode of action of these terminators is determined to be an increase in mRNA half-life. Furthermore, we demonstrate that constructs comprising completely nonviral regulatory elements (i.e., promoters and terminators) can outperform commonly used, strong viral based elements by nearly 2-fold. Ultimately, this novel set of terminators expanded our genetic toolkit for engineering mammalian host cells.},

Here, we created a platform for the massively parallel screening of barcoded combinatorial gene perturbations in human cells and translated these hits into effective drug combinations. This technology leverages the simplicity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for multiplexed targeting of specific genomic loci and the versatility of combinatorial genetics en masse (CombiGEM) to rapidly assemble barcoded combinatorial genetic libraries that can be tracked with high-throughput sequencing. We applied CombiGEM-CRISPR to create a library of 23,409 barcoded dual guide-RNA (gRNA) combinations and then perform a high-throughput pooled screen to identify gene pairs that inhibited ovarian cancer cell growth when they were targeted. We validated the growth-inhibiting effects of specific gene sets, including epigenetic regulators KDM4C/BRD4 and KDM6B/BRD4, via individual assays with CRISPR-Cas–based knockouts and RNA-interference–based knockdowns. We also tested small-molecule drug pairs directed against our pairwise hits and showed that they exerted synergistic antiproliferative effects against ovarian cancer cells. We envision that the CombiGEM-CRISPR platform will be applicable to a broad range of biological settings and will accelerate the systematic identification of genetic combinations and their translation into novel drug combinations that modulate complex human disease phenotypes.},

However, limitations of existing multiplex assay methods in cultured mammalian cells hinder the breadth, speed and scale of these experiments. Here, we describe a series of improvements that greatly enhance the capabilities of a Bxb1 recombinase-based landing pad system for conducting different types of multiplex genetic assays in various mammalian cell lines. We incorporate the landing pad into a lentiviral vector, easing the process of generating new landing pad cell lines. We also develop several new landing pad versions, including one where the Bxb1 recombinase is expressed from the landing pad itself, improving recombination efficiency more than 2-fold and permitting rapid prototyping of transgenic constructs. Other versions incorporate positive and negative selection markers that enable drug-based enrichment of recombinant cells, enabling the use of larger libraries and reducing costs. A version with dual convergent promoters allows enrichment of recombinant cells independent of transgene expression, permitting the assessment of libraries of transgenes that perturb cell growth and survival. Lastly, we demonstrate these improvements by assessing the effects of a combinatorial library of oncogenes and tumor suppressors on cell growth. Collectively, these advancements make multiplex genetic assays in diverse cultured cell lines easier, cheaper and more effective, facilitating future studies probing how proteins impact cell function, using transgenic variant libraries tested individually or in combination.},

Here we describe two panels of potent and selective luciferase reporter cell lines based on cells with low endogenous steroid receptor activity (U2OS). The panels contain reporter cell lines for estrogen receptors α and β, androgen, glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and progesterone receptors. In the first panel, the activation of either synthetic, steroid response elements containing promoter or viral promoter is mediated by full-length steroid receptors. The second panel is based on the expression of the chimeric receptor, which was created by the replacement of the N-terminal part of the molecule by Gal4 DBD and that binds to multiple UAS sites in the reporter promoter. Both panels were extensively characterized by profiling 28 ligands in dose response manner in agonist and antagonist mode. We have analyzed and compared the responses to tested ligands from both panels and concluded that in general both systems generated similar qualitative response in terms of potency, efficacy, partial agonism/antagonism, mixed agonistic/antagonistic profiles and the rank of potencies was well conserved between both panels. However, we have also identified some artifacts introduced by the Gal4/LBD reporter assays in contrast to their full-length receptor reporter counterparts. Keeping in mind the advantages and drawbacks of each reporter format, these cell lines represent powerful and selective tools for profiling large compound libraries (HTS) and for detailed study of mechanisms by which compounds exert their biological effects.},

	abstract = {Although nonclassical estrogen actions initiated at the cell surface have been described in many tissues, the identities of the membrane estrogen receptors (mERs) mediating these actions remain unclear. Here we show that GPR30, an orphan receptor unrelated to nuclear estrogen receptors, has all the binding and signaling characteristics of a mER. A high-affinity (dissociation constant 2.7 nm), limited capacity, displaceable, single binding site specific for estrogens was detected in plasma membranes of SKBR3 breast cancer cells that express GPR30 but lack nuclear estrogen receptors. Progesterone-induced increases and small interfering RNA-induced decreases in GPR30 expression in SKBR3 cells were accompanied by parallel changes in specific estradiol-17β (E2) binding. Plasma membranes of human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with GPR30, but not those of untransfected cells, and human placental tissues that express GPR30 also displayed high-affinity, specific estrogen binding typical of mERs. E2 treatment of transfected cell membranes caused activation of a stimulatory G protein that is directly coupled to the receptor, indicating GPR30 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), and also increased adenylyl cyclase activity. The finding that the antiestrogens tamoxifen and ICI 182,780, and an environmental estrogen, ortho,para-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (o,p′-DDE), have high binding affinities to the receptor and mimic the actions of E2 has important implications for both the development and treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer. GPR30 is structurally unrelated to the recently discovered family of GPCR-like membrane progestin receptors. The identification of a second distinct class of GPCR-like steroid membrane receptors suggests a widespread role for GPCRs in nonclassical steroid hormone actions.},

Their identification and characterization is fundamental to our understanding of gene regulation. Features that are associated with enhancer activity, such as regulatory factor binding or histone modifications can predict the location of enhancers. Nonetheless, enhancer activity can only be assessed by transcriptional reporter assays. Over the past years massively parallel reporter assays have been developed for large scale testing of enhancers. In this review we focus on the principles and applications of STARR-seq, a functional assay that quantifies enhancer strengths in complex candidate libraries and thus allows activity-based enhancer identification in entire genomes.

	abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is an essential component of all metabolic pathways. At the most basic level, a protein binds to a particular DNA sequence (operator) on the genome and either positively or negatively alters the level of transcription. Together, the protein and its operator form an epigenetic switch that regulates gene expression. In an effort to produce a ‘better’ switch, we have discovered novel facets of the lac operon that are responsible for optimal functionality. We have uncovered a relationship between operator binding affinity and inducibility and demonstrated that the operator DNA is not a passive component of a genetic switch; it is responsible for establishing binding affinity, specificity as well as translational efficiency. In addition, an operator's directionality can indirectly affect gene expression. Unraveling the basic properties of this classical epigenetic switch demonstrates that multiple factors must be optimized in designing a better switch.},

	abstract = {A large variety of proteins bind to specific parts of the genome to regulate gene expression, DNA replication, and chromatin structure. DamID is a powerful method used to map the genomic interaction sites of these proteins in vivo. It is based on fusing a protein of interest to Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase (dam). Expression of this fusion protein in vivo leads to preferential methylation of adenines in DNA surrounding the native binding sites of the dam fusion partner. Because adenine methylation does not occur endogenously in most eukaryotes, it provides a unique tag to mark protein interaction sites. The adenine‐methylated DNA fragments are isolated by selective polymerase chain reaction amplification and can be identified by microarray hybridization. We and others have successfully applied DamID to the genome‐wide identification of interaction sites of several transcription factors and other chromatin‐associated proteins. This chapter discusses DamID technology in detail, and a step‐by‐step experimental protocol is provided for use in Drosophila cell lines.},

	abstract = {RNA–protein interactions differ from DNA–protein interactions because of the central role of RNA secondary structure. Some RNA-binding domains (RBDs) recognize their target sites mainly by their shape and geometry and others are sequence-specific but are sensitive to secondary structure context. A number of small- and large-scale experimental approaches have been developed to measure RNAs associated in vitro and in vivo with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Generalizing outside of the experimental conditions tested by these assays requires computational motif finding. Often RBP motif finding is done by adapting DNA motif finding methods; but modeling secondary structure context leads to better recovery of RBP-binding preferences. Genome-wide assessment of mRNA secondary structure has recently become possible, but these data must be combined with computational predictions of secondary structure before they add value in predicting in vivo binding. There are two main approaches to incorporating structural information into motif models: supplementing primary sequence motif models with preferred secondary structure contexts (e.g., MEMERIS and RNAcontext) and directly modeling secondary structure recognized by the RBP using stochastic context-free grammars (e.g., CMfinder and RNApromo). The former better reconstruct known binding preferences for sequence-specific RBPs but are not suitable for modeling RBPs that recognize shape and geometry of RNAs. Future work in RBP motif finding should incorporate interactions between multiple RBDs and multiple RBPs in binding to RNA. WIREs RNA 2014, 5:111–130. doi: 10.1002/wrna.1201},

We present Protein Occupancy Profile-Sequencing (POP-seq), a phase separation based method in three versions, one of which does not require crosslinking, thus providing unbiased protein occupancy profiles on whole cell transcriptome without the requirement of poly-A pulldown. Our study demonstrates that {\textasciitilde} 68\% of the total POP-seq peaks exhibited an overlap with publicly available protein–RNA interaction profiles of 97 RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in K562 cells. We show that POP-seq variants consistently capture protein–RNA interaction sites across a broad range of genes including on transcripts encoding for transcription factors (TFs), RNA-Binding Proteins (RBPs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). POP-seq identified peaks exhibited a significant enrichment (p value {\textless} 2.2e−16) for GWAS SNPs, phenotypic, clinically relevant germline as well as somatic variants reported in cancer genomes, suggesting the prevalence of uncharacterized genomic variation in protein occupied sites on RNA. We demonstrate that the abundance of POP-seq peaks increases with an increase in expression of lncRNAs, suggesting that highly expressed lncRNA are likely to act as sponges for RBPs, contributing to the rewiring of protein–RNA interaction network in cancer cells. Overall, our data supports POP-seq as a robust and cost-effective method that could be applied to primary tissues for mapping global protein occupancies.},

We analyze the structural and mechanistic origins of loss of function and use the experimental data to find residues important for enzymatic activity. We performed computational analyses of protein stability and evolutionary conservation and show how we may predict positions where variants cause loss of activity or abundance.

E2 actions are mediated by two classical nuclear hormone receptors, estrogen receptor α and β (ERs). The activity of ERs depends on the coordinated activity of ligand binding, post-translational modifications (PTMs), and importantly the interaction with their partner proteins called “coregulators.” Because coregulators are proved to be crucial for ER transcriptional activity, and majority of breast cancers are ERα positive, an increased interest in the field has led to the identification of a large number of coregulators. In the last decade, gene knockout studies using mouse models provided impetus to our further understanding of the role of these coregulators in mammary gland development. Several coregulators appear to be critical for terminal end bud (TEB) formation, ductal branching and alveologenesis during mammary gland development. The emerging studies support that, coregulators along with the other ER partner proteins called “pioneer factors” together contribute significantly to E2 signaling and mammary cell fate. This review discusses emerging themes in coregulator and pioneer factor mediated action on ER functions, in particular their role in mammary gland cell fate and development.},

A time-resolved fluorescence-based binding assay was used to determine the dissociation constants for the 10 NR boxes derived from the three p160 coactivators for both ER subtypes in the presence of the each of the agonists. While the affinity of some NR boxes for ER was independent of the agonist, we identified several NR boxes that had significantly different affinities for ER depending on which agonist was bound to the receptor. Therefore, an agonist may specify the affinity of an NR for various NR boxes and thus regulate the coactivator selectivity of the receptor.},

Numerous GR cofactors have been identified, but they alone are insufficient to dictate the specificity of GR action. Furthermore, the role of different functional surfaces on the receptor itself in regulating its targets is unclear, due in part to the paucity of known target genes. Using DNA microarrays and real-time quantitative PCR, we identified genes transcriptionally activated by GR, in a translation-independent manner, in two human cell lines. We then assessed in U2OS osteosarcoma cells the consequences of individually disrupting three GR domains, the N-terminal activation function (AF) 1, the C-terminal AF2, or the dimer interface, on activation of these genes. We found that GR targets differed in their requirements for AF1 or AF2, and that the dimer interface was dispensable for activation of some genes in each class. Thus, in a single cell type, different GR surfaces were used in a gene-specific manner. These findings have strong implications for the nature of gene response element signaling, the composition and structure of regulatory complexes, and the mechanisms of context-specific transcriptional regulation.},

While nature provides an array of naturally occurring RNA-binding proteins, developing de novo RNA-binding peptides remains challenging. In particular, tailoring peptides to target single-stranded RNA with low complexity is difficult due to the inherent structural flexibility of RNA molecules. Here, we developed a codon-restricted mRNA display and identified multiple de novo peptides from a peptide library that bind to poly(C) and poly(A) RNA with KDs ranging from micromolar to submicromolar concentrations. One of the newly identified peptides is capable of binding to the cytosine-rich sequences of the oncogenic Cdk6 3′UTR RNA and MYU lncRNA, with affinity comparable to that of the endogenous binding protein. Hence, we present a novel platform for discovering de novo single-stranded RNA-binding peptides that offer promising avenues for regulating RNA functions.},

These chimeric sequences are subsequently converted into a sequencing library suitable for paired-end sequencing. A standardized bioinformatic software package, iMARGI-Docker, is provided to decode the paired-end sequencing data into caRNA–DNA interactions. Compared to its predecessor MARGI (mapping RNA–genome interactions), the number of input cells for iMARGI is 3–5 million (a 100-fold reduction), experimental time is reduced, and clear checkpoints have been established. It takes a few hours a day and a total of 8 d to complete the construction of an iMARGI sequencing library and 1 d to carry out data processing with iMARGI-Docker.},

	abstract = {Fusion transcripts are used as biomarkers in companion diagnoses. Although more than 15,000 fusion RNAs have been identified from diverse cancer types, few common features have been reported. Here, we compared 16,410 fusion transcripts detected in cancer (from a published cohort of 9,966 tumor samples of 33 cancer types) with genome-wide RNA–DNA interactions mapped in two normal, noncancerous cell types [using iMARGI, an enhanced version of the mapping of RNA–genome interactions (MARGI) assay]. Among the top 10 most significant RNA–DNA interactions in normal cells, 5 colocalized with the gene pairs that formed fusion RNAs in cancer. Furthermore, throughout the genome, the frequency of a gene pair to exhibit RNA–DNA interactions is positively correlated with the probability of this gene pair to present documented fusion transcripts in cancer. To test whether RNA–DNA interactions in normal cells are predictive of fusion RNAs, we analyzed these in a validation cohort of 96 lung cancer samples using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Thirty-seven of 42 fusion transcripts in the validation cohort were found to exhibit RNA–DNA interactions in normal cells. Finally, by combining RNA-seq, single-molecule RNA FISH, and DNA FISH, we detected a cancer sample with EML4-ALK fusion RNA without forming the EML4-ALK fusion gene. Collectively, these data suggest an RNA-poise model, where spatial proximity of RNA and DNA could poise for the creation of fusion transcripts.},

Here we introduce a new data set of RNA elements in the human genome that are recognized by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), generated as part of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project phase III. This class of regulatory elements functions only when transcribed into RNA, as they serve as the binding sites for RBPs that control post-transcriptional processes such as splicing, cleavage and polyadenylation, and the editing, localization, stability and translation of mRNAs. We describe the mapping and characterization of RNA elements recognized by a large collection of human RBPs in K562 and HepG2 cells. Integrative analyses using five assays identify RBP binding sites on RNA and chromatin in vivo, the in vitro binding preferences of RBPs, the function of RBP binding sites and the subcellular localization of RBPs, producing 1,223 replicated data sets for 356 RBPs. We describe the spectrum of RBP binding throughout the transcriptome and the connections between these interactions and various aspects of RNA biology, including RNA stability, splicing regulation and RNA localization. These data expand the catalogue of functional elements encoded in the human genome by the addition of a large set of elements that function at the RNA level by interacting with RBPs.},

	abstract = {RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play crucial roles in regulating every stage of the mRNA life cycle and mediating non-coding RNA functions. Despite their importance, the specific roles of most RBPs remain unexplored because we do not know what specific RNAs most RBPs bind. Current methods, such as crosslinking and immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (CLIP-seq), have expanded our knowledge of RBP-RNA interactions but are generally limited by their ability to map only one RBP at a time. To address this limitation, we developed SPIDR (Split and Pool Identification of RBP targets), a massively multiplexed method to simultaneously profile global RNA binding sites of dozens to hundreds of RBPs in a single experiment. SPIDR employs split-pool barcoding coupled with antibody-bead barcoding to increase the throughput of current CLIP methods by two orders of magnitude. SPIDR reliably identifies precise, single-nucleotide RNA binding sites for diverse classes of RBPs simultaneously. Using SPIDR, we explored changes in RBP binding upon mTOR inhibition and identified that 4EBP1 acts as a dynamic RBP that selectively binds to 5’-untranslated regions of specific translationally repressed mRNAs only upon mTOR inhibition. This observation provides a potential mechanism to explain the specificity of translational regulation controlled by mTOR signaling. SPIDR has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of RNA biology and both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation by enabling rapid, de novo discovery of RNA-protein interactions at an unprecedented scale.},

However, for most allosteric proteins identified to date the mechanistic details of allosteric modulation are not yet well understood. Uncovering common mechanistic patterns underlying allostery would allow not only a better academic understanding of the phenomena, but it would also streamline the design of novel therapeutic solutions. This relatively unexplored therapeutic potential and the putative advantages of allosteric drugs over classical active-site inhibitors fuel the attention allosteric-drug research is receiving at present. A first step to harness the regulatory potential and versatility of allosteric sites, in the context of drug-discovery and design, would be to detect or predict their presence and location. In this article, we describe a simple computational approach, based on the effect allosteric ligands exert on protein flexibility upon binding, to predict the existence and position of allosteric sites on a given protein structure.},

Although the three-dimensional (3D) structures of many enzyme-ligand complexes are available, it is still difficult to rationally engineer an allosterically regulatable enzyme without decreasing its catalytic activity. Here, we describe an effective strategy to deregulate the allosteric inhibition of enzymes based on the molecular evolution and physicochemical characteristics of allosteric ligand-binding sites. We found that allosteric sites are evolutionarily variable and comprised of more hydrophobic residues than catalytic sites. We applied our findings to design mutations in selected target residues that deregulate the allosteric activity of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase). Specifically, charged amino acids at less conserved positions were substituted with hydrophobic or neutral amino acids with similar sizes. The engineered proteins successfully diminished the allosteric inhibition of E. coli FBPase without affecting its catalytic efficiency. We expect that our method will aid the rational design of enzyme allosteric regulation strategies and facilitate the control of metabolic flux.},

	abstract = {Control of protein activity in living cells can reveal the role of spatiotemporal dynamics in signaling circuits. Protein analogs with engineered allosteric responses can be particularly effective in the interrogation of protein signaling, as they can replace endogenous proteins with minimal perturbation of native interactions. However, it has been a challenge to identify allosteric sites in target proteins where insertion of responsive domains produces an allosteric response comparable to the activity of native proteins. Here, we describe a detailed protocol to generate genetically encoded analogs of proteins that can be allosterically controlled by either rapamycin or blue light, as well as experimental procedures to produce and test these analogs in vitro and in mammalian cell lines. We describe computational methods, based on crystal structures or homology models, to identify effective sites for insertion of either an engineered rapamycin-responsive (uniRapR) domain or the light-responsive light–oxygen–voltage 2 (LOV2) domain. The inserted domains allosterically regulate the active site, responding to rapamycin with irreversible activation, or to light with reversible inactivation at higher spatial and temporal resolution. These strategies have been successfully applied to catalytic domains of protein kinases, Rho family GTPases, and guanine exchange factors (GEFs), as well as the binding domain of a GEF Vav2. Computational tasks can be completed within a few hours, followed by 1–2 weeks of experimental validation. We provide protocols for computational design, cloning, and experimental testing of the engineered proteins, using Src tyrosine kinase, GEF Vav2, and Rho GTPase Rac1 as examples.},

We present a function-centric approach using deep mutational scanning to elucidate the molecular basis and underlying functional landscape of allostery. We show that allosteric signaling exhibits a high degree of functional plasticity and redundancy through myriad mutational pathways. Residues critical for allosteric signaling are surprisingly poorly conserved while those required for structural integrity are highly conserved, suggesting evolutionary pressure to preserve fold over function. Our results suggest multiple solutions to the thermodynamic conditions of cooperativity, in contrast to the common view of a finely tuned allosteric residue network maintained under selection.},

	abstract = {Naturally occurring protein switches have been repurposed for the development of biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications1. However, the number of such switches is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest2. The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)3, we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibodies against the membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. The former, which incorporates a de novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder4, has a limit of detection of 15 pM and a luminescence signal 50-fold higher than the background level. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes, and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.},

	abstract = {Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can compete with endogenous hormones and bind to the orthosteric site of nuclear receptors (NRs), affecting normal endocrine system function and causing severe symptoms. Recently, a series of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been discovered to bind to the allosteric sites of NRs and induce similar effects. However, it remains unclear how diverse EDCs work in this new way. Therefore, we have systematically summarized the allosteric sites and underlying mechanisms based on existing studies, mainly regarding drugs belonging to the PPCP class. Advanced methods, classified as structural biology, biochemistry and computational simulation, together with their advantages and hurdles for allosteric site recognition and mechanism insight have also been described. Furthermore, we have highlighted two available strategies for virtual screening of numerous EDCs, relying on the structural features of allosteric sites and lead compounds, respectively. We aim to provide reliable theoretical and technical support for a broader view of various allosteric interactions between EDCs and NRs, and to drive high-throughput and accurate screening of potential EDCs with non-competitive effects.},

Many others are complex and act as tiny microprocessors, responding to a variety of signals that they interpret and integrate to switch the neighboring gene on or off. Whether complex or simple, these switching devices contain two types of fundamental components: (1) short stretches of DNA of defined sequence and (2) gene regulatory proteins that recognize and bind to them.},

Their functions include control of transcription and translation, DNA repair, splicing, apoptosis and mediating stress responses.Orthogonal binding of DNA and RNA provides an opportunity for competitive regulation of transcription by decoy RNAs, which can be mRNAs, tRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Simultaneous binding of DNA and RNA facilitates the assembly of RNA-tethered transcriptional complexes, allowing the recruitment of RNA-containing complexes to specific DNA loci.Binding to both DNA and RNA enables DRBPs to integrate multiple signals into cellular signalling networks and allows improved gene targeting, finer control of gene expression and incorporation of metabolic states or stresses to modulate protein activity.The structural features of DRBPs have been remarkably well conserved during evolution, indicating that dual nucleic acid binding confers selective advantages. DRBPs may have less stringent criteria for interacting with nucleic acids or may adjust their structure when DNA and RNA compete for the same DRBP interaction surface.Nucleic acid sequence evolution has an important role in the development of DRBP function. Emerging studies of rapidly evolving lncRNAs suggest that RNA binding by proteins that were previously thought of as DNA-specific may be a widespread phenomenon.},

Here we describe a DNA microarray-based method to characterize sequence-specific DNA recognition by zinc-finger proteins. A phage display library, prepared by randomizing critical amino acid residues in the second of three fingers of the mouse Zif268 domain, provided a rich source of zinc-finger proteins with variant DNA-binding specificities. Microarrays containing all possible 3-bp binding sites for the variable zinc fingers permitted the quantitation of the binding site preferences of the entire library, pools of zinc fingers corresponding to different rounds of selection from this library, as well as individual Zif268 variants that were isolated from the library by using specific DNA sequences.

Comparison of these proteins' in vitro binding sites with their in vivo binding sites indicates that PBM-derived sequence specificities can accurately reflect in vivo DNA sequence specificities. In addition to previously identified targets, Abf1, Rap1 and Mig1 bound to 107, 90 and 75 putative new target intergenic regions, respectively, many of which were upstream of previously uncharacterized open reading frames. Comparative sequence analysis indicated that many of these newly identified sites are highly conserved across five sequenced sensu stricto yeast species and, therefore, are probably functional in vivo binding sites that may be used in a condition-specific manner. Similar PBM experiments should be useful in identifying new cis regulatory elements and transcriptional regulatory networks in various genomes.},

	abstract = {Gene regulation at the transcriptional level is a central process in all organisms, and DNA-binding transcription factors, known as TFs, play a fundamental role. This class of proteins usually binds at specific DNA sequences, activating or repressing gene expression. In general, TFs are composed of two domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an extra domain, which in this work we have named “companion domain” (CD). This latter could be involved in one or more functions such as ligand binding, protein-protein interactions or even with enzymatic activity. In contrast to DBDs, which have been widely characterized both experimentally and bioinformatically, information on the abundance, distribution, variability and possible role of the CDs is scarce. Here, we investigated these issues associated with the domain architectures of TFs in prokaryotic genomes. To this end, 19 families of TFs in 761 non-redundant bacterial and archaeal genomes were evaluated. In this regard we found four main groups based on the abundance and distribution in the analyzed genomes: i) LysR and TetR/AcrR; ii) AraC/XylS, SinR, and others; iii) Lrp, Fis, ArsR, and others; and iv) a group that included only two families, ArgR and BirA. Based on a classification of the organisms according to the life-styles, a major abundance of regulatory families in free-living organisms, in contrast with pathogenic, extremophilic or intracellular organisms, was identified. Finally, the protein architecture diversity associated to the 19 families considering a weight score for domain promiscuity evidenced which regulatory families were characterized by either a large diversity of CDs, here named as “promiscuous” families given the elevated number of variable domains found in those TFs, or a low diversity of CDs. Altogether this information helped us to understand the diversity and distribution of the 19 Prokaryotes TF families. Moreover, initial steps were taken to comprehend the variability of the extra domain in those TFs, which eventually might assist in evolutionary and functional studies.},

However, the modes of interaction between transcription factors and nucleosomal DNA remain largely unknown. Here we systematically explore interactions between the nucleosome and 220 transcription factors representing diverse structural families. Consistent with earlier observations, we find that the majority of the studied transcription factors have less access to nucleosomal DNA than to free DNA. The motifs recovered from transcription factors bound to nucleosomal and free DNA are generally similar. However, steric hindrance and scaffolding by the nucleosome result in specific positioning and orientation of the motifs. Many transcription factors preferentially bind close to the end of nucleosomal DNA, or to periodic positions on the solvent-exposed side of the DNA. In addition, several transcription factors usually bind to nucleosomal DNA in a particular orientation. Some transcription factors specifically interact with DNA located at the dyad position at which only one DNA gyre is wound, whereas other transcription factors prefer sites spanning two DNA gyres and bind specifically to each of them. Our work reveals notable differences in the binding of transcription factors to free and nucleosomal DNA, and uncovers a diverse interaction landscape between transcription factors and the nucleosome.},

Key cell-cell communication pathways use multiple promiscuously interacting ligands and receptors, provoking the question of how addressing specificity can emerge from molecular promiscuity. To investigate this issue, we developed a general mathematical modeling framework based on the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway architecture. We find that promiscuously interacting ligand-receptor systems allow a small number of ligands, acting in combinations, to address a larger number of individual cell types, defined by their receptor expression profiles. Promiscuous systems outperform seemingly more specific one-to-one signaling architectures in addressing capability. Combinatorial addressing extends to groups of cell types, is robust to receptor expression noise, grows more powerful with increases in the number of receptor variants, and is maximized by specific biochemical parameter relationships. Together, these results identify design principles governing cellular addressing by ligand combinations.},

Here we report a method for antibody discovery that leverages the Illumina HiSeq platform to, within 3 days, screen in the order of 108 antibody–antigen interactions. The method, which we named ‘deep screening’, involves the clustering and sequencing of antibody libraries, the conversion of the DNA clusters into complementary RNA clusters covalently linked to the instrument’s flow-cell surface on the same location, the in situ translation of the clusters into antibodies tethered via ribosome display, and their screening via fluorescently labelled antigens. By using deep screening, we discovered low-nanomolar nanobodies to a model antigen using 4 × 106 unique variants from yeast-display-enriched libraries, and high-picomolar single-chain antibody fragment leads for human interleukin-7 directly from unselected synthetic repertoires. We also leveraged deep screening of a library of 2.4 × 105 sequences of the third complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain of an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody as input for a large language model that generated new single-chain antibody fragment sequences with higher affinity for HER2 than those in the original library.},

	abstract = {The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is an evolutionally conserved nuclear receptor superfamily protein that mediates the diverse actions of glucocorticoids as a ligand-dependent transcription factor. This receptor is a protein that shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon binding to its ligand glucocorticoid hormone, where it modulates the transcription rates of glucocorticoid-responsive genes positively or negatively. Tremendous efforts have been made to reveal the molecular signaling actions of the GR, including intracellular shuttling, transcriptional regulation and interaction with other intracellular signaling pathways. Glucocorticoids are essential for both maintenance of the resting state and the stress response, and are pivotal in the treatment of many disorders, including autoimmune, inflammatory, allergic, and lymphoproliferative diseases. Thus, pathologic or therapeutic implications of the GR, including genetic alterations in the human GR gene, disease-associated GR regulatory molecules, and development of GR ligands with selective GR actions, are of great importance. This chapter provides an overview on such GR-related research activities. For complete coverage of all related areas of Endocrinology, please visit our on-line FREE web-text, WWW.ENDOTEXT.ORG.},

	abstract = {The p160/steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family comprises three pleiotropic coregulators (SRC-1, SRC-2, and SRC-3; otherwise known as NCOA1, NCOA2, and NCOA3, respectively), which modulate a wide spectrum of physiological responses and clinicopathologies. Such pleiotropy is achieved through their inherent structural complexity, which allows this coregulator class to control both nuclear receptor and non-nuclear receptor signaling. As observed in other physiologic systems, members of the SRC family have recently been shown to play pivotal roles in uterine biology and pathobiology. In the murine uterus, SRC-1 is required to launch a full steroid hormone response, without which endometrial decidualization is markedly attenuated. From “dovetailing” clinical and mouse studies, an isoform of SRC-1 was recently identified which promotes endometriosis by reprogramming endometrial cells to evade apoptosis and to colonize as endometriotic lesions within the peritoneal cavity. The endometrium fails to decidualize without SRC-2, which accounts for the infertility phenotype exhibited by mice devoid of this coregulator. In related studies on human endometrial stromal cells, SRC-2 was shown to act as a molecular “pacemaker” of the glycolytic flux. This finding is significant because acceleration of the glycolytic flux provides the necessary bioenergy and biomolecules for endometrial stromal cells to switch from quiescence to a proliferative phenotype, a critical underpinning in the decidual progression program. Although studies on uterine SRC-3 function are in their early stages, clinical studies provide tantalizing support for the proposal that SRC-3 is causally linked to endometrial hyperplasia as well as with endometrial pathologies in patients diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome. This proposal is now driving the development and application of innovative technologies, particularly in the mouse, to further understand the functional role of this elusive uterine coregulator in normal and abnormal physiologic contexts. Because dysregulation of this coregulator triad potentially presents a triple threat for increased risk of subfecundity, infertility, or endometrial disease, a clearer understanding of the individual and combinatorial roles of these coregulators in uterine function is urgently required. This minireview summarizes our current understanding of uterine SRC function, with a particular emphasis on the next critical questions that need to be addressed to ensure significant expansion of our knowledge of this underexplored field of uterine biology.},

The p160/SRC/NCoA coactivator family comprises three members (NCoA-1, -2 and -3), which are organized in multiprotein coactivator complexes. We had identified the PAS-B domain of NCoA-1 as an LXXLL motif binding domain. Here we show that NCoA family members are able to interact with other full-length NCoA proteins via their PAS-B domain and they specifically interact with the CBP-interaction domain (CID/AD1) of NCoA-1. Peptide competition, binding experiments and mutagenesis of LXXLL motifs point at distinct binding motif specificities of the NCoA PAS-B domains. NMR studies of different NCoA-1-PAS-B/LXXLL peptide complexes revealed similar although not identical binding sites for the CID/AD1 and STAT6 transactivation domain LXXLL motifs. In mechanistic studies, we found that overexpression of the PAS-B domain is able to disturb the binding of NCoA-1 to CBP in cells and that a CID/AD1 peptide competes with STAT6 for NCoA-1 in vitro. Moreover, the expression of an endogenous androgen receptor target gene is affected by the overexpression of the NCoA-1 or NCoA-3 PAS-B domains. Our study discloses a new, complementary mechanism for the current model of coactivator recruitment to target gene promoters.},

Yet, whether and how DNA-mediated allostery plays a regulatory role in gene expression remained unclear. Here, we show that DNA indeed transmits allosteric signals over long distances to boost the binding cooperativity of transcription factors. Phenotype switching in Bacillus subtilis requires an all-or-none promoter binding of multiple ComK proteins. We use single-molecule FRET to demonstrate that ComK-binding at one promoter site increases affinity at a distant site. Cryo-EM structures of the complex between ComK and its promoter demonstrate that this coupling is due to mechanical forces that alter DNA curvature. Modifications of the spacer between sites tune cooperativity and show how to control allostery, which allows a fine-tuning of the dynamic properties of genetic circuits.},

In this perspective, we will use the LacI TF as the principal exemplar for engineering alternate functions related to allostery—i.e., alternate protein DNA interactions, alternate protein-ligand interactions, and alternate phenotypic mechanisms. In addition, we will summarize the design rules and heuristics for each design goal and demonstrate how the resulting design rules and heuristics can be extrapolated to engineer other aTFs with a similar topology—i.e., from the broader LacI/GalR family of TFs.},

Tamoxifen can reduce the risk of breast cancer and, at same time, prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen is widely prescribed for treatment and prevention of breast cancer. Mechanistically the activity of SERMs is determined by the selective recruitment of coactivators and corepressors in different cell types and tissues.

However, it is still unclear whether xenoestrogens affect the normal behavior of ERα and/or ERβ subsequent to receptor binding. In view of the wide range of structural forms now recognized to mimic the actions of the natural estrogens, we have assessed the ability of ERα and ERβ to recruit TIF2 and SRC-1a in the presence of 17β-estradiol, genistein, diethylstilbestrol, 4-tert-octylphenol, 2′,3′,4′,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl-ol, and bisphenol A. We show that ligand-dependent differences exist in the ability of ERα and ERβ to bind coactivator proteinsin vitro, despite the similarity in binding affinity of the various ligands for both ER subtypes. The enhanced ability of ERβ (over ERα) to recruit coactivators in the presence of xenoestrogens was consistent with a greater ability of ERβ to potentiate reporter gene activity in transiently transfected HeLa cells expressing SRC-1e and TIF2. We conclude that ligand-dependent differences in the ability of ERα and ERβ to recruit coactivator proteins may contribute to the complex tissue-dependent agonistic/antagonistic responses observed with certain xenoestrogens.},

	abstract = {The human estrogen receptor α (hERα) is involved in the regulation of growth, development, and tissue homeostasis. Agonists that bind to the receptor’s ligand-binding domain (LBD) lead to recruitment of coactivators and the enhancement of gene expression. In contrast, antagonists bind to the LBD and block the binding of coactivators thus decreasing gene expressions. In this work, we carry out simulations using the AWSEM (Associative memory, Water mediated, Structure and Energy Model)-Suite force field along with the 3SPN.2C force field for DNA to predict the structure of hERα and study its dynamics when binding to DNA and coactivators. Using simulations of antagonist-bound hERα and agonist-bound hERα by themselves and also along with bound DNA and coactivators, principal component analyses and free energy landscape analyses capture the pathway of domain–domain communication for agonist-bound hERα. This communication is mediated through the hinge domains that are ordinarily intrinsically disordered. These disordered segments manipulate the hinge domains much like the strings of a marionette as they twist in different ways when antagonists or agonists are bound to the ligand-binding domain.},

Our structural model suggests the following assembly mechanism for the complex: each of the two ligand-bound ERα monomers independently recruits one SRC-3 protein via the transactivation domain of ERα; the two SRC-3s in turn bind to different regions of one p300 protein through multiple contacts. We also present structural evidence for the location of activation function 1 (AF-1) in a full-length nuclear receptor, which supports a role for AF-1 in SRC-3 recruitment.},

Here, to annotate genomic binding sites of known and unexamined NRs more accurately, we use high-throughput SELEX to comprehensively map DNA binding site preferences of all full-length human NRs, in complex with their ligands. Furthermore, to identify non-obvious binding sites buried in DNA–protein interactomes, we develop MinSeq Find, a search algorithm based on the MinTerm concept from electrical engineering and digital systems design. The resulting MinTerm sequence set (MinSeqs) reveal a constellation of binding sites that more effectively annotate NR-binding profiles in cells. MinSeqs also unmask binding sites created or disrupted by 52,106 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with human diseases. By implicating druggable NRs as hidden drivers of multiple human diseases, our results not only reveal new biological roles of NRs, but they also provide a resource for drug-repurposing and precision medicine.},

In this review, we discuss the human non-coding variants and their contributions to human diseases in the following four parts. (i) Functional annotations of non-coding SNPs mapped by GWAS: we discuss recent progress revealing some of the molecular mechanisms for GWAS signals affecting gene function. (ii) Technical progress in interpretation of non-coding variants: we briefly describe some of the technologies for functional annotations of non-coding variants, including the methods for genome-wide mapping of chromatin interaction, computational tools for functional predictions and the new genome editing technologies useful for dissecting potential functional consequences of non-coding variants.

Eighty-eight percent of such DHSs are active during fetal development and are enriched in variants associated with gestational exposure–related phenotypes. We identified distant gene targets for hundreds of variant-containing DHSs that may explain phenotype associations. Disease-associated variants systematically perturb transcription factor recognition sequences, frequently alter allelic chromatin states, and form regulatory networks. We also demonstrated tissue-selective enrichment of more weakly disease-associated variants within DHSs and the de novo identification of pathogenic cell types for Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and an electrocardiogram trait, without prior knowledge of physiological mechanisms.

In breast cancer, the estrogen receptor (ER) drives cell growth, proliferation, and metastasis, and the androgen receptor (AR) plays a similar role in prostate cancer. Accordingly, treatment of these diseases has focused on blocking steroid hormone receptor function. In contrast, glucocorticoids (GCs) work through GR to arrest growth and induce apoptosis in lymphoid tissue. Glucocorticoids are amazingly effective in this role, and have been deployed as the cornerstone of lymphoid cancer treatment for decades. Unfortunately, not all patients respond to GCs and dosage is restricted by immediate and long term side effects. In this chapter we review the treatment protocols that employ glucocorticoids as a curative agent, elaborate on what is known about their mechanism of action in these cancers, and also summarize the palliative uses of glucocorticoids for other cancers.},

However, a protein’s biological function often depends on multiple conformational substates2, and disease-causing point mutations often cause population changes within these substates3,4. We demonstrate that clustering a multiple-sequence alignment by sequence similarity enables AlphaFold2 to sample alternative states of known metamorphic proteins with high confidence. Using this method, named AF-Cluster, we investigated the evolutionary distribution of predicted structures for the metamorphic protein KaiB5 and found that predictions of both conformations were distributed in clusters across the KaiB family. We used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to confirm an AF-Cluster prediction: a cyanobacteria KaiB variant is stabilized in the opposite state compared with the more widely studied variant. To test AF-Cluster’s sensitivity to point mutations, we designed and experimentally verified a set of three mutations predicted to flip KaiB from Rhodobacter sphaeroides from the ground to the fold-switched state. Finally, screening for alternative states in protein families without known fold switching identified a putative alternative state for the oxidoreductase Mpt53 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Further development of such bioinformatic methods in tandem with experiments will probably have a considerable impact on predicting protein energy landscapes, essential for illuminating biological function.},

In this work, we introduce MMDiff, a generative model that jointly designs sequences and structures of nucleic acid and protein complexes, independently or in complex, using joint SE(3)-discrete diffusion noise. Such a model has important implications for emerging areas of macromolecular design including structure-based transcription factor design and design of noncoding RNA sequences. We demonstrate the utility of MMDiff through a rigorous new design benchmark for macromolecular complex generation that we introduce in this work. Our results demonstrate that MMDiff is able to successfully generate micro-RNA and single-stranded DNA molecules while being modestly capable of joint modeling DNA and RNA molecules in interaction with multi-chain protein complexes.

Remarkably, the remaining motifs are composed of variably-spaced half-sites (12\%) or ‘emergent’ sites (16\%) that cannot be readily inferred from half-site preferences of partnering monomers. These binding sites were biochemically validated by EMSA-FRET analysis and validated in vivo by ChIP-seq data from human cell lines. Focusing on ATF3, we observed distinct cognate site preferences conferred by different bZIP partners, and demonstrated that genome-wide binding of ATF3 is best explained by considering many dimers in which it participates. Importantly, our compendium of bZIP-DNA interactomes predicted bZIP binding to 156 disease associated SNPs, of which only 20 were previously annotated with known bZIP motifs.},

Perturbations to this process underlie diverse diseases, but the clonal contributions to human hematopoiesis and how this changes with age remain incompletely understood. While recent insights have emerged from barcoding studies in model systems4,5,16,17, simultaneous detection of cell states and phylogenies from natural barcodes in humans has been challenging. Here, we introduce an improved single-cell lineage tracing system based on deep detection of naturally-occurring mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations with simultaneous readout of transcriptional states and chromatin accessibility. We use this system to define the clonal architecture of HSCs and map the physiological state and output of clones. We uncover functional heterogeneity in HSC clones, which is stable over months and manifests as differences in total HSC output as well as biases toward the production of different mature cell types. We also find that the diversity of HSC clones decreases dramatically with age leading to an oligoclonal structure with multiple distinct clonal expansions. Our study thus provides the first clonally-resolved and cell-state aware atlas of human hematopoiesis at single-cell resolution revealing an unappreciated functional diversity of human HSC clones and more broadly paves the way for refined studies of clonal dynamics across a range of tissues in human health and disease.},

Traditional strategies to enhance protein solubility and structural stability are introduced. The designs of stable protein complexes and high-order assemblies are covered. Computational methodologies behind these endeavors, including structure prediction programs, machine learning algorithms, and specialty software dedicated to the evaluation of protein solubility and aggregation, are discussed.

In engineering MPs, it can be extremely challenging to retain membrane localization capability while changing other desired properties. We have used structure-guided SCHEMA recombination to create a large set of functionally diverse chimeras from three sequence-diverse channelrhodopsins (ChRs). We chose 218 ChR chimeras from two SCHEMA libraries and assayed them for expression and plasma membrane localization in human embryonic kidney cells. The majority of the chimeras express, with 89\% of the tested chimeras outperforming the lowest-expressing parent; 12\% of the tested chimeras express at even higher levels than any of the parents. A significant fraction (23\%) also localize to the membrane better than the lowest-performing parent ChR. Most (93\%) of these well-localizing chimeras are also functional light-gated channels. Many chimeras have stronger light-activated inward currents than the three parents, and some have unique off-kinetics and spectral properties relative to the parents. An effective method for generating protein sequence and functional diversity, SCHEMA recombination can be used to gain insights into sequence–function relationships in MPs.},

	abstract = {Identification of metabolic engineering targets is a fundamental challenge in strain development programs. While high-throughput (HTP) genetic engineering methodologies capable of generating vast diversity are being developed at a rapid rate, a majority of industrially interesting molecules cannot be screened at sufficient throughput to leverage these techniques. We propose a workflow that couples HTP screening of common precursors (e.g., amino acids) that can be screened either directly or by artificial biosensors, with low-throughput targeted validation of the molecule of interest to uncover nonintuitive beneficial metabolic engineering targets and combinations hereof. Using this workflow, we identified several nonobvious novel targets for improving p-coumaric acid (p-CA) and l-DOPA production from two large 4k gRNA libraries each deregulating 1000 metabolic genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We initially screened yeast cells transformed with gRNA library plasmids for individual regulatory targets improving the production of l-tyrosine-derived betaxanthins, identifying 30 targets that increased intracellular betaxanthin content 3.5–5.7 fold. Hereafter, we screened the targets individually in a high-producing p-CA strain, narrowing down the targets to six that increased the secreted titer by up to 15\%. To investigate whether any of the six targets could be additively combined to improve p-CA production further, we created a gRNA multiplexing library and subjected it to our proposed coupled workflow. The combination of regulating PYC1 and NTH2 simultaneously resulted in the highest (threefold) improvement of the betaxanthin content, and an additive trend was also observed in the p-CA strain. Lastly, we tested the initial 30 targets in a l-DOPA producing strain, identifying 10 targets that increased the secreted titer by up to 89\%, further validating our screening by proxy workflow. This coupled approach is useful for strain development in the absence of direct HTP screening assays for products of interest.},

A community-driven review in 2013 described the emerging commonalities in the biosynthesis of RiPPs and the opportunities they offered for bioengineering and genome mining. Since then, the field has seen tremendous advances in understanding of the mechanisms by which nature assembles these compounds, in engineering their biosynthetic machinery for a wide range of applications, and in the discovery of entirely new RiPP families using bioinformatic tools developed specifically for this compound class. The First International Conference on RiPPs was held in 2019, and the meeting participants assembled the current review describing new developments since 2013. The review discusses the new classes of RiPPs that have been discovered, the advances in our understanding of the installation of both primary and secondary post-translational modifications, and the mechanisms by which the enzymes recognize the leader peptides in their substrates. In addition, genome mining tools used for RiPP discovery are discussed as well as various strategies for RiPP engineering. An outlook section presents directions for future research.},

	abstract = {We have recently established a new protein-engineering strategy termed “directed domain-interface evolution” that generates a binding site by linking two protein domains and then optimizing the interface between them. Employing this strategy, we have generated synthetic two-domain “affinity clamps” using PDZ and fibronectin type III (FN3) domains as the building blocks. While these affinity clamps all had significantly higher affinity toward a target peptide than the underlying PDZ domain, two distinct types of affinity clamps were found in terms of target specificity. One type conserved the specificity of the parent PDZ domain, and the other dramatically increased the specificity. Here, we characterized their specificity profiles using peptide phage-display libraries and scanning mutagenesis, which suggested a significantly enlarged recognition site of the high-specificity affinity clamps. The crystal structure of a high-specificity affinity clamp showed extensive contacts with a portion of the peptide ligand that is not recognized by the PDZ domain, thus rationalizing the affinity clamp’s improvement in specificity. A comparison with another affinity clamp structure revealed that, although both had extensive contacts between PDZ and FN3 domains, they exhibited a large offset in the relative position of the two domains. Our results indicate that linked domains could rapidly fuse and evolve as a single functional module and that the inherent plasticity of domain interfaces allows for the generation of diverse active-site topography. These attributes of directed domain-interface evolution provide facile means to generate synthetic proteins with a broad range of functions.},

	abstract = {Covering: up to 2021, Metagenomics has yielded massive amounts of sequencing data offering a glimpse into the biosynthetic potential of the uncultivated microbial majority. While genome-resolved information about microbial communities from nearly every environment on earth is now available, the ability to accurately predict biocatalytic functions directly from sequencing data remains challenging. Compared to primary metabolic pathways, enzymes involved in secondary metabolism often catalyze specialized reactions with diverse substrates, making these pathways rich resources for the discovery of new enzymology. To date, functional insights gained from studies on environmental DNA (eDNA) have largely relied on PCR- or activity-based screening of eDNA fragments cloned in fosmid or cosmid libraries. As an alternative, shotgun metagenomics holds underexplored potential for the discovery of new enzymes directly from eDNA by avoiding common biases introduced through PCR- or activity-guided functional metagenomics workflows. However, inferring new enzyme functions directly from eDNA is similar to searching for a ‘needle in a haystack’ without direct links between genotype and phenotype. The goal of this review is to provide a roadmap to navigate shotgun metagenomic sequencing data and identify new candidate biosynthetic enzymes. We cover both computational and experimental strategies to mine metagenomes and explore protein sequence space with a spotlight on natural product biosynthesis. Specifically, we compare in silico methods for enzyme discovery including phylogenetics, sequence similarity networks, genomic context, 3D structure-based approaches, and machine learning techniques. We also discuss various experimental strategies to test computational predictions including heterologous expression and screening. Finally, we provide an outlook for future directions in the field with an emphasis on meta-omics, single-cell genomics, cell-free expression systems, and sequence-independent methods., Shotgun metagenomic approaches to uncover new enzymes are underdeveloped relative to PCR- or activity-based functional metagenomics. Here we review computational and experimental strategies to discover biosynthetic enzymes from metagenomes.},

	abstract = {Efforts are underway to construct several recoded genomes anticipated to exhibit multivirus resistance, enhanced nonstandard amino acid (nsAA) incorporation, and capability for synthetic biocontainment. Although our laboratory pioneered the first genomically recoded organism (Escherichia coli strain C321.∆A), its fitness is far lower than that of its nonrecoded ancestor, particularly in defined media. This fitness deficit severely limits its utility for nsAA-linked applications requiring defined media, such as live cell imaging, metabolic engineering, and industrial-scale protein production. Here, we report adaptive evolution of C321.∆A for more than 1,000 generations in independent replicate populations grown in glucose minimal media. Evolved recoded populations significantly exceeded the growth rates of both the ancestral C321.∆A and nonrecoded strains. We used next-generation sequencing to identify genes mutated in multiple independent populations, and we reconstructed individual alleles in ancestral strains via multiplex automatable genome engineering (MAGE) to quantify their effects on fitness. Several selective mutations occurred only in recoded evolved populations, some of which are associated with altering the translation apparatus in response to recoding, whereas others are not apparently associated with recoding, but instead correct for off-target mutations that occurred during initial genome engineering. This report demonstrates that laboratory evolution can be applied after engineering of recoded genomes to streamline fitness recovery compared with application of additional targeted engineering strategies that may introduce further unintended mutations. In doing so, we provide the most comprehensive insight to date into the physiology of the commonly used C321.∆A strain.},

	abstract = {Most models of gene duplication assume that the ancestral functions of the preduplication gene are independent and can therefore be neatly partitioned between descendant paralogs. However, many gene products, such as transcriptional regulators, are components within cooperative assemblies; here, we show that a natural consequence of duplication and divergence of such proteins can be competitive interference between the paralogs. Our example is based on the duplication of the essential MADS-box transcriptional regulator Mcm1, which is found in all fungi and regulates a large set of genes. We show that a set of historical amino acid sequence substitutions minimized paralog interference in contemporary species and, in doing so, increased the molecular complexity of this gene regulatory network. We propose that paralog interference is a common constraint on gene duplicate evolution, and its resolution, which can generate additional regulatory complexity, is needed to stabilize duplicated genes in the genome.},

This approach often assumes that an interface-disrupting mutation in one protein drives selection of a compensatory mutation in its partner during evolution. However, this model requires a non-functional intermediate state prior to the compensatory change. Alternatively, a mutation in one protein could first broaden its specificity, allowing changes in its partner, followed by a specificity-restricting mutation. Using bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems, we demonstrate the plausibility of this second, promiscuity-based model. By screening large libraries of interface mutants, we show that toxins and antitoxins with high specificity are frequently connected in sequence space to more promiscuous variants that can serve as intermediates during a reprogramming of interaction specificity. We propose that the abundance of promiscuous variants promotes the expansion and diversification of toxin-antitoxin systems and other paralogous protein families during evolution.},

To tackle this challenge, we examined the divergent evolution of a model bacterial signaling pathway comprising the kinase PhoR and its cognate substrate PhoB. We show that the specificity-determining residues of these proteins are typically under purifying selection but have, in α-proteobacteria, undergone a burst of diversification followed by extended stasis. By reversing mutations that accumulated in an α-proteobacterial PhoR, we demonstrate that these substitutions were adaptive, enabling PhoR to avoid crosstalk with a paralogous pathway that arose specifically in α-proteobacteria. Our findings demonstrate that duplication and the subsequent need to avoid crosstalk strongly influence signaling protein evolution. These results provide a concrete example of how system-wide insulation can be achieved postduplication through a surprisingly limited number of mutations. Our work may help explain the apparent ease with which paralogous protein families expanded in all organisms.},

Our results reveal extensive degeneracy in the PhoQ-PhoP interface and epistasis, with the effect of individual substitutions often highly dependent on context. Together, epistasis and the genetic code create a pattern of connectivity of functional variants in sequence space that likely constrains PhoQ evolution.

Engineered sensors have also been developed that allow small molecules or light to precisely control biological responses.Engineering highly diverse sensors remains a big challenge in synthetic biology. However, some examples, such as chimeric T cell receptors that incorporate a single-chain antibody as the extracellular domain, offer a strategy for custom receptor design.The modularity of intracellular signalling proteins can be exploited to generate diverse signal processing circuits. Many protein circuits are dependent on the organization of key proteins into specific complexes and assemblies. Thus, recombination and reorganization of specific catalytic domains with different interaction domains provides a way for both evolution and engineering to generate novel circuit wiring.The modification of spatially controlled signalling circuits can lead to cells with new morphological behaviours.Advances that may facilitate the engineering of customized signalling include improved molecular tool kits that are optimized for predictability, and incorporation of combinatorial library design into the engineering process.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms play an essential part in many biological processes, and only three prokaryotic proteins are required to constitute a true post-translational circadian oscillator1. The evolutionary history of the three Kai proteins indicates that KaiC is the oldest member and a central component of the clock2. Subsequent additions of KaiB and KaiA regulate the phosphorylation state of KaiC for time synchronization. The canonical KaiABC system in cyanobacteria is well understood3–6, but little is known about more ancient systems that only possess KaiBC. However, there are reports that they might exhibit a basic, hourglass-like timekeeping mechanism7–9. Here we investigate the primordial circadian clock in Rhodobacter sphaeroides, which contains only KaiBC, to elucidate its inner workings despite missing KaiA. Using a combination of X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy, we find a new dodecameric fold for KaiC, in which two hexamers are held together by a coiled-coil bundle of 12 helices. This interaction is formed by the carboxy-terminal extension of KaiC and serves as an ancient regulatory moiety that is later superseded by KaiA. A coiled-coil register shift between daytime and night-time conformations is connected to phosphorylation sites through a long-range allosteric network that spans over 140 Å. Our kinetic data identify the difference in the ATP-to-ADP ratio between day and night as the environmental cue that drives the clock. They also unravel mechanistic details that shed light on the evolution of self-sustained oscillators.},

	abstract = {The functional consequences of structural variants (SVs) in mammalian genomes are challenging to study. This is due to several factors, including: 1) their numerical paucity relative to other forms of standing genetic variation such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertions or deletions (indels); 2) the fact that a single SV can involve and potentially impact the function of more than one gene and/or cis regulatory element; and 3) the relative immaturity of methods to generate SVs, either randomly or in targeted fashion, in in vitro or in vivo model systems. Towards addressing some of these challenges, we developed Genome-Shuffle-seq, a straightforward method that enables the multiplex generation of several major forms of SVs (deletions, inversions, translocations) throughout a mammalian genome. Genome-Shuffle-seq is based on the random integration of “shuffle cassettes” to the genome, wherein each shuffle cassette contains components that facilitate its site-specific recombination (SSR) with other integrated shuffle cassettes (via Cre-loxP), its mapping to a specific genomic location (via T7-mediated in vitro transcription or IVT), and its identification in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data (via T7-mediated in situ transcription or IST). In this proof-of-concept, we apply Genome-Shuffle-seq to induce and map thousands of genomic SVs in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in a single experiment. Induced SVs are rapidly depleted from the cellular population over time, possibly due to some combination of Cre-mediated toxicity and negative selection on the rearrangements themselves. We demonstrate that we can efficiently genotype which SVs are present in association with each of many single cell transcriptomes in scRNA-seq data. Finally, preliminary evidence suggests our method may be a powerful means of generating extrachromosomal circular DNAs (ecDNAs). Looking forward, we anticipate that Genome-Shuffle-seq may be broadly useful for the systematic exploration of the functional consequences of SVs on gene expression, the chromatin landscape, and 3D nuclear architecture. We further anticipate potential uses for in vitro modeling of ecDNAs, as well as in paving the path to a minimal mammalian genome.},

We applied this workflow to (i) identify 16 candidate TFs from over a hundred uncharacterized genes; (ii) capture a total of 255 DNA binding peaks for ten candidate TFs resulting in six high-confidence binding motifs; (iii) reconstruct the regulons of these ten TFs by determining gene expression changes upon deletion of each TF and (iv) identify the regulatory roles of three TFs (YiaJ, YdcI, and YeiE) as regulators of l-ascorbate utilization, proton transfer and acetate metabolism, and iron homeostasis under iron-limited conditions, respectively.

	abstract = {Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins are among the most important classes of gene regulatory proteins, controlling changes in transcription that underlie many aspects of biology. In this work, we identify a transcriptional regulator from the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans that binds DNA specifically but has no detectable homology with any previously described DNA- or RNA-binding protein. This protein, named White–Opaque Regulator 3 (Wor3), regulates white–opaque switching, the ability of C. albicans to switch between two heritable cell types. We demonstrate that ectopic overexpression of WOR3 results in mass conversion of white cells to opaque cells and that deletion of WOR3 affects the stability of opaque cells at physiological temperatures. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation of Wor3 and gene expression profiling of a wor3 deletion mutant strain indicate that Wor3 is highly integrated into the previously described circuit regulating white–opaque switching and that it controls a subset of the opaque transcriptional program. We show by biochemical, genetic, and microfluidic experiments that Wor3 binds directly to DNA in a sequence-specific manner, and we identify the set of cis-regulatory sequences recognized by Wor3. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that the Wor3 family arose more recently in evolutionary time than most previously described DNA-binding domains; it is restricted to a small number of fungi that include the major fungal pathogens of humans. These observations show that new families of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins may be restricted to small clades and suggest that current annotations—which rely on deep conservation—underestimate the fraction of genes coding for transcriptional regulators.},

Helical linkers are thought to act as rigid spacers separating two domains. Non-helical linkers are rich in prolines, which also leads to structural rigidity and isolation of the linker from the attached domains. This means that both linker types are likely to act as a scaffold to prevent unfavourable interactions between folding domains. Based on these results we have constructed a linker database intended for the rational design of linkers for domain fusion, which can be accessed via the Internet at http://mathbio.nimr.mrc.ac.uk.},

To understand the selective advantage of genetically encoding more than 20 amino acids, we investigated the proteome-wide response to reducing the genetic code of Methanosarcina acetivorans from 21 to 20 amino acids. The data show how a natural proteome adapts to genetic code reduction and indicate that the selective value of an expanded genetic code is related to carbon source range and metabolic efficiency., Expanding the genetic code is an important aim of synthetic biology, but some organisms developed naturally expanded genetic codes long ago over the course of evolution. Less than 1\% of all sequenced genomes encode an operon that reassigns the stop codon UAG to pyrrolysine (Pyl), a genetic code variant that results from the biosynthesis of Pyl-tRNAPyl. To understand the selective advantage of genetically encoding more than 20 amino acids, we constructed a markerless tRNAPyl deletion strain of Methanosarcina acetivorans (ΔpylT) that cannot decode UAG as Pyl or grow on trimethylamine. Phenotypic defects in the ΔpylT strain were evident in minimal medium containing methanol. Proteomic analyses of wild type (WT) M. acetivorans and ΔpylT cells identified 841 proteins from {\textgreater}7,000 significant peptides detected by MS/MS. Protein production from UAG-containing mRNAs was verified for 19 proteins. Translation of UAG codons was verified by MS/MS for eight proteins, including identification of a Pyl residue in PylB, which catalyzes the first step of Pyl biosynthesis. Deletion of tRNAPyl globally altered the proteome, leading to {\textgreater}300 differentially abundant proteins. Reduction of the genetic code from 21 to 20 amino acids led to significant down-regulation in translation initiation factors, amino acid metabolism, and methanogenesis from methanol, which was offset by a compensatory (100-fold) up-regulation in dimethyl sulfide metabolic enzymes. The data show how a natural proteome adapts to genetic code reduction and indicate that the selective value of an expanded genetic code is related to carbon source range and metabolic efficiency.},

	abstract = {Organisms possessing genetic codes with unassigned codons raise the question of how cellular machinery resolves such codons and how this could impact horizontal gene transfer. Here, we use a genomically recoded Escherichia coli to examine how organisms address translation at unassigned UAG codons, which obstruct propagation of UAG-containing viruses and plasmids. Using mass spectrometry, we show that recoded organisms resolve translation at unassigned UAG codons via near-cognate suppression, dramatic frameshifting from at least −3 to +19 nucleotides, and rescue by ssrA-encoded tmRNA, ArfA, and ArfB. We then demonstrate that deleting tmRNA restores expression of UAG-ending proteins and propagation of UAG-containing viruses and plasmids in the recoded strain, indicating that tmRNA rescue and nascent peptide degradation is the cause of impaired virus and plasmid propagation. The ubiquity of tmRNA homologs suggests that genomic recoding is a promising path for impairing horizontal gene transfer and conferring genetic isolation in diverse organisms.},

	abstract = {Modern organisms commonly use the same set of 20 genetically coded amino acids for protein synthesis with very few exceptions. However, earlier protein synthesis was plausibly much simpler than modern one and utilized only a limited set of amino acids. Nevertheless, few experimental tests of this issue with arbitrarily chosen amino acid sets had been reported prior to this report. Herein we comprehensively and systematically reduced the size of the amino acid set constituting an ancestral nucleoside kinase that was reconstructed in our previous study. We eventually found that two convergent sequences, each comprised of a 13-amino acid alphabet, folded into soluble, stable and catalytically active structures, even though their stabilities and activities were not as high as those of the parent protein. Notably, many but not all of the reduced-set amino acids coincide with those plausibly abundant in primitive Earth. The inconsistent amino acids appeared to be important for catalytic activity but not for stability. Therefore, our findings suggest that the prebiotically abundant amino acids were used for creating stable protein structures and other amino acids with functional side chains were recruited to achieve efficient catalysis.},

This set was likely canonicalized during early evolution; before this, smaller amino acid sets were gradually expanded as new synthetic, proofreading and coding mechanisms became biologically available. Many possible subsets of the modern CAAs or other presently uncoded amino acids could have comprised the earlier sets. We explore the hypothesis that the CAAs were selectively fixed due to their unique adaptive chemical properties, which facilitate folding, catalysis, and solubility of proteins, and gave adaptive value to organisms able to encode them. Specifically, we studied in silico hypothetical CAA sets of 3–19 amino acids comprised of 1913 structurally diverse α-amino acids, exploring the adaptive value of their combined physicochemical properties relative to those of the modern CAA set. We find that even hypothetical sets containing modern CAA members are especially adaptive; it is difficult to find sets even among a large choice of alternatives that cover the chemical property space more amply. These results suggest that each time a CAA was discovered and embedded during evolution, it provided an adaptive value unusual among many alternatives, and each selective step may have helped bootstrap the developing set to include still more CAAs.},

T7 phage has drawn massive attention in precision medicine owing to its distinctive advantages, such as short replication cycle, ease in displaying peptides and proteins, high stability and cloning efficiency, facile manipulation, and convenient storage. By introducing foreign gene into phage DNA, T7 phage can present foreign peptides or proteins site‐specifically on its capsid, enabling it to become a nanoparticle that can be genetically engineered to screen and display a peptide or protein capable of recognizing a specific target with high affinity. This review critically introduces the biomedical use of T7 phage, ranging from the detection of serological biomarkers and bacterial pathogens, recognition of cells or tissues with high affinity, design of gene vectors or vaccines, to targeted therapy of different challenging diseases (e.g., bacterial infection, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, inflammatory disease, and foot–mouth disease). It also discusses perspectives and challenges in exploring T7 phage, including the understanding of its interactions with human body, assembly into scaffolds for tissue regeneration, integration with genome editing, and theranostic use in clinics. As a genetically modifiable biological nanoparticle, T7 phage holds promise as biomedical imaging probes, therapeutic agents, drug and gene carriers, and detection tools., T7 phage can be genetically engineered to display targeting motifs that recognize cells or tissues with high affinity, enabling it to serve as a disease site‐homing drug, a gene delivery carrier, a vaccine, an antibacterial agent, or a probe for detecting biomarkers and pathogens.},

In part, this is because the NTD AFs appear to be unfolded when expressed as recombinant proteins. Recent studies have begun to shed light on the structure and function of the NTD AFs. Recombinant NTD AFs can be made to fold by application of certain osmolytes or when expressed in conjunction with a DNA-binding domain by binding that DNA-binding domain to a DNA response element. The sequence of the DNA binding site may affect the functional state of the AFs domain. If properly folded, NTD AFs can bind certain cofactors and primary transcription factors. Through these, and/or by direct interactions, the NTD AFs may interact with the AF2 domain in the ligand binding, carboxy-terminal portion of the NHRs. We propose models for the folding of the NTD AFs and their protein-protein interactions.},

RNP-MaP uses a hetero-bifunctional crosslinker to freeze interacting proteins in place on RNA and then maps multiple bound proteins on single RNA strands by read-through reverse transcription and DNA sequencing. RNP-MaP revealed that RNase P and RMRP, two sequence-divergent but structurally related non-coding RNAs, share RNP networks and that network hubs define functional sites in these RNAs. RNP-MaP also identified protein interaction networks conserved between mouse and human XIST long non-coding RNAs and defined protein communities whose binding sites colocalize and form networks in functional regions of XIST.

The receptor proteins have a conserved domain organization, comprising a C-terminal LBD (ligand-binding domain), a hinge region, a central DBD (DNA-binding domain) and a highly variable NTD (N-terminal domain). The NTD is structurally flexible and contains surfaces for both activation and repression of gene transcription, and the strength of the transactivation response has been correlated with protein length.

	abstract = {The activation functions AF1 and AF2 of nuclear receptors mediate the recruitment of coregulators in gene regulation. AF1 is mapped to the highly variable and intrinsically unstructured N terminal domain and AF2 lies in the conserved ligand binding domain. The unstructured nature of AF1 offers structural plasticity and hence functional versatility in gene regulation. However, little is known about the key functional residues of AF1 that mediates its interaction with coregulators. This study focuses on the progesterone receptor (PR) and reports the identification of K464, K481 and R492 (KKR) as the key functional residues of PR AF1. The KKR are monomethylated and function cooperatively. The combined mutations of KKR to QQQ render PR isoform B (PRB) hyperactive, whereas KKR to FFF mutations abolishes as much as 80\% of PR activity. Furthermore, the hyperactive QQQ mutation rescues the loss of PR activity due to E911A mutation in AF2. The study also finds that the magnitudes of the mutational effect differ in different cell types as a result of differential effects on the functional interaction with coregulators. Furthermore, KKR provides the interface for AF1 to physically interact with p300 and SRC-1, and with AF2 at E911. Intriguingly, the inactive FFF mutant interacts strikingly stronger with both SRC-1 and AF2 than wt PRB. We propose a tripartite model to describe the dynamic interactions between AF1, AF2 and SRC-1 with KKR of AF1 and E911 of AF2 as the interface. An overly stable interaction would hamper the dynamics of disassembly of the receptor complex.},

The development of orthogonal translation systems that allow for the codon-specific incorporation of noncanonical amino acids may provide a means to expand the code, but these translation systems cannot be simply superimposed on cells that have spent billions of years optimizing their genomes with the canonical code. We have therefore carried out directed evolution experiments with an orthogonal translation system that inserts 3-nitro-L-tyrosine across from amber codons, creating a 21 amino acid genetic code in which the amber stop codon ambiguously encodes either 3-nitro-L-tyrosine or stop. The 21 amino acid code is enforced through the inclusion of an addicted, essential gene, a beta-lactamase dependent upon 3-nitro-L-tyrosine incorporation. After 2000 generations of directed evolution, the fitness deficit of the original strain was largely repaired through mutations that limited the toxicity of the noncanonical. While the evolved lineages had not resolved the ambiguous coding of the amber codon, the improvements in fitness allowed new amber codons to populate protein coding sequences.},

Further, we provided three of the phage populations’ access to a new genetic code in which Amber codons could be read as selenocysteine, potentially allowing the formation of more stable selenide-containing bonds. Phage virions responded to the thermal challenges with a greater than 10°C increase in heat tolerance and fixed highly reproducible patterns of non-synonymous substitutions and genome deletions. Most fixed mutations mapped to either the tail complex or to the three internal virion proteins that form a pore across the E. coli cell membrane during DNA injection. However, few global changes in Amber codon usage were observed, with only one natural Amber codon being lost. These results reinforce a model in which adaptation to thermal stress proceeds via the cumulative fixation of a small set of highly adaptive substitutions and that adaptation to new genetic codes proceeds only slowly, even with the possibility of potential phenotypic advantages.},

They appear to act as intrinsically disordered “hub proteins” that integrate the activities of a range of transcription factors with a number of histone modifying enzymes. Although these co-repressor proteins are challenging targets for structural studies due to their largely unstructured character, a number of structures have recently been determined of co-repressor interaction regions in complex with their interacting partners. These have yielded considerable insight into the mechanism of assembly of these complexes, the structural basis for the specificity of the interactions and also open opportunities for targeting these interactions therapeutically.},

	abstract = {Estrogen receptor (ER) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily whose members share conserved domain structures, including a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD). Estrogenic chemicals work as ligands for activation or repression of ER-mediated transcriptional activity derived from two transactivation domains: AF-1 and AF-2. AF-2 is localized in the LBD, and helix 12 of the LBD is essential for controlling AF-2 functionality. The positioning of helix 12 defines the ER alpha (ERα) ligand properties as agonists or antagonists. In contrast, it is still less well defined as to the ligand-dependent regulation of N-terminal AF-1 activity. It has been thought that the action of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) is mediated by the regulation of a tissue specific AF-1 activity rather than AF-2 activity. However, it is still unclear how SERMs regulate AF-1 activity in a tissue-selective manner. This review presents some recent observations toward information of ERα mediated SERM actions related to the ERα domain functionality, focusing on the following topics. (1) The F-domain, which is connected to helix 12, controls 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) mediated AF-1 activation associated with the receptor dimerization activity. (2) The zinc-finger property of the DBD for genomic sequence recognition. (3) The novel estrogen responsive genomic DNA element, which contains multiple long-spaced direct-repeats without a palindromic ERE sequence, is differentially recognized by 4OHT and E2 ligand bound ERα transactivation complexes.},

One common assumption is that such complex pattern formation requires spatial isolation or long evolutionary timescales. We show that multiscale network structure can evolve rapidly under simple ecological conditions without spatial structure. In just 21 days of laboratory coevolution, Escherichia coli and bacteriophage Φ21 coevolve and diversify to form elaborate cross-infection networks. By measuring {\textasciitilde}10,000 phage-bacteria infections and testing the genetic basis of interactions, we identify the mechanisms that create each component of the multiscale pattern. Our results demonstrate how multiscale networks evolve in parasite-host systems, illustrating Darwin’s idea that simple adaptive processes can generate entangled banks of ecological interactions.},

	abstract = {Bacteriophages, or phages, are viruses with an exquisitely evolved structure to accomplish their goals. These goals are recognizing a suitable host bacterium, profiting from the host metabolism, and producing multiple progeny phages that are stable enough to survive until they find a new host bacterium to infect. Their genomes consist of single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, single-stranded DNA, or double-stranded DNA, depending on phage type. They store their genome in highly symmetric protein capsids to protect it from degradation. Often these capsids are icosahedral, but helical and other shapes are also used. Tectiviridae and Corticoviridae have an internal lipid membrane, while Cystoviridae sport an outer membrane layer. Phages with tails, belonging to the Caudovirales order, are the most commonly encountered bacteriophages and have icosahedral or prolate capsids. In addition to the capsid, phages need a host cell recognition apparatus. The small icosahedral Leviviridae have a single minor capsid protein for this purpose. More complex phages dedicate multiple proteins to host cell recognition, and examples of this are the helical Inoviridae and the icosahedral Tectiviridae, Corticoviridae, and Cystoviridae. The Caudovirales have highly efficient tail protein complexes for DNA transfer. These tails are flexible (Siphoviridae), extensible (Podoviridae), or contractile (Myoviridae). Apart from elements designed for genome protection, host recognition, and genome transfer, more complicated phage particles may contain proteins for environmental sensing, binding to suitable matrices where host bacteria are likely to be encountered, and other functions.},

	abstract = {Inconsistent results on the association between evolutionary rates and amino acid composition of proteins have been reported in eukaryotes. However, there are few studies of how amino acid composition can influence evolutionary rates in bacteria. Thus, we constructed linear regression models between composition frequencies of amino acids and evolutionary rates for bacteria. Compositions of all amino acids can on average explain 21.5\% of the variation in evolutionary rates among 273 investigated bacterial organisms. In five model organisms, amino acid composition contributes more to variation in evolutionary rates than protein abundance, and frequency of optimal codons. The contribution of individual amino acid composition to evolutionary rate varies among organisms. The closer the GC-content of genome to its maximum or minimum, the better the correlation between the amino acid content and the evolutionary rate of proteins would appear in that genome. The types of amino acids that significantly contribute to evolutionary rates can be grouped into GC-rich and AT-rich amino acids. Besides, the amino acid with high composition also contributes more to evolutionary rates than amino acid with low composition in proteome. In summary, amino acid composition significantly contributes to the rate of evolution in bacterial organisms and this in turn is impacted by GC-content.},

This report focuses on prebiotic and metabolic aspects of amino acids and proteins starting with meteorites, followed by their formation, including peptides, under plausible prebiotic conditions, and the major biosynthetic pathways in the various kingdoms of life. Coenzymes play a key role in the present analysis in that amino acid metabolism is linked to glycolysis and different variants of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA, rTCA, and the incomplete horseshoe version) as well as the biosynthesis of the most important coenzymes.

Estimates are based upon the composition of conserved residues in descendant sequences and empirical knowledge of the relative probability of conservation of various amino acids. Simulations are used to model and correct for errors in the estimates. The method was used to infer the amino acid composition of a large protein set in the Last Universal Ancestor (LUA) of all extant species. Relative to the modern protein set, LUA proteins were found to be generally richer in those amino acids that are believed to have been most abundant in the prebiotic environment and poorer in those amino acids that are believed to have been unavailable or scarce. It is proposed that the inferred amino acid composition of proteins in the LUA probably reflects historical events in the establishment of the genetic code.},

The porcine donor was engineered to carry 69 genomic edits, eliminating glycan antigens, overexpressing human transgenes and inactivating porcine endogenous retroviruses. In vitro functional analyses showed that the edited kidney endothelial cells modulated inflammation to an extent that was indistinguishable from that of human endothelial cells, suggesting that these edited cells acquired a high level of human immune compatibility. When transplanted into cynomolgus monkeys, the kidneys with three glycan antigen knockouts alone experienced poor graft survival, whereas those with glycan antigen knockouts and human transgene expression demonstrated significantly longer survival time, suggesting the benefit of human transgene expression in vivo. These results show that preclinical studies of renal xenotransplantation could be successfully conducted in nonhuman primates and bring us closer to clinical trials of genetically engineered porcine renal grafts.},

However, proteomic profiling of RBPs has been mostly limited to polyadenylated mRNA-binding proteins, leaving RBPs on nonpoly(A) RNAs, including most noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and pre-mRNAs, largely undiscovered. Here we present a click chemistry-assisted RNA interactome capture (CARIC) strategy, which enables unbiased identification of RBPs, independent of the polyadenylation state of RNAs. CARIC combines metabolic labeling of RNAs with an alkynyl uridine analog and in vivo RNA-protein photocross-linking, followed by click reaction with azide-biotin, affinity enrichment, and proteomic analysis. Applying CARIC, we identified 597 RBPs in HeLa cells, including 130 previously unknown RBPs. These newly discovered RBPs can likely bind ncRNAs, thus uncovering potential involvement of ncRNAs in processes previously unknown to be ncRNA-related, such as proteasome function and intermediary metabolism. The CARIC strategy should be broadly applicable across various organisms to complete the census of RBPs.},

	abstract = {Most known pathogenic mutations occur in protein-coding regions of DNA and change the way proteins are made. Taking protein structure into account has therefore provided great insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying human genetic disease. While there has been much focus on how mutations can disrupt protein structure and thus cause a loss of function (LOF), alternative mechanisms, specifically dominant-negative (DN) and gain-of-function (GOF) effects, are less understood. Here, we investigate the protein-level effects of pathogenic missense mutations associated with different molecular mechanisms. We observe striking differences between recessive vs dominant, and LOF vs non-LOF mutations, with dominant, non-LOF disease mutations having much milder effects on protein structure, and DN mutations being highly enriched at protein interfaces. We also find that nearly all computational variant effect predictors, even those based solely on sequence conservation, underperform on non-LOF mutations. However, we do show that non-LOF mutations could potentially be identified by their tendency to cluster in three-dimensional space. Overall, our work suggests that many pathogenic mutations that act via DN and GOF mechanisms are likely being missed by current variant prioritisation strategies, but that there is considerable scope to improve computational predictions through consideration of molecular disease mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Massively parallel measurements of dominant-negative inhibition by protein fragments have been used to map protein interaction sites and discover peptide inhibitors. However, the underlying principles governing fragment-based inhibition have thus far remained unclear. Here, we adapted a high-throughput inhibitory fragment assay for use in Escherichia coli, applying it to a set of 10 essential proteins. This approach yielded single amino acid resolution maps of inhibitory activity, with peaks localized to functionally important interaction sites, including oligomerization interfaces and folding contacts. Leveraging these data, we performed a systematic analysis to uncover principles of fragment-based inhibition. We determined a robust negative correlation between susceptibility to inhibition and cellular protein concentration, demonstrating that inhibitory fragments likely act primarily by titrating native protein interactions. We also characterized a series of trade-offs related to fragment length, showing that shorter peptides allow higher-resolution mapping but suffer from lower inhibitory activity. We employed an unsupervised statistical analysis to show that the inhibitory activities of protein fragments are largely driven not by generic properties such as charge, hydrophobicity, and secondary structure, but by the more specific characteristics of their bespoke macromolecular interactions. Overall, this work demonstrates fundamental characteristics of inhibitory protein fragment function and provides a foundation for understanding and controlling protein interactions in vivo.},

	abstract = {Peptides can bind to specific sites on larger proteins and thereby function as inhibitors and regulatory elements. Peptide fragments of larger proteins are particularly attractive for achieving these functions due to their inherent potential to form native-like binding interactions. Recently developed experimental approaches allow for high-throughput measurement of protein fragment inhibitory activity in living cells. However, it has thus far not been possible to predict de novo which of the many possible protein fragments bind their protein targets, let alone act as inhibitors. We have developed a computational method, FragFold, that employs AlphaFold to predict protein fragment binding to full-length protein targets in a high-throughput manner. Applying FragFold to thousands of fragments tiling across diverse proteins revealed peaks of predicted binding along each protein sequence. These predictions were compared with experimentally measured peaks of inhibitory activity in E. coli. We establish that our approach is a sensitive predictor of protein fragment function: Evaluating inhibitory fragments derived from known protein-protein interaction interfaces, we found 87\% were predicted by FragFold to bind in a native-like mode. Across full protein sequences, 68\% of FragFold-predicted binding peaks match experimentally measured inhibitory peaks. This is true even when the underlying inhibitory mechanism is unclear from existing structural data, and we find FragFold is able to predict novel binding modes for inhibitory fragments of unknown structure, explaining previous genetic and biochemical data for these fragments. The success rate of FragFold demonstrates that this computational approach should be broadly applicable for discovering inhibitory protein fragments across proteomes.},

Here, we introduce “CAR Pooling,” a multiplexed approach to rapidly identify CAR designs with clinical potential. Forty CARs with signaling domains derived from a range of immune cell lineages were evaluated in pooled assays for their ability to stimulate critical T cell effector functions during repetitive stimulation that mimics long-term tumor antigen exposure. Several domains were identified from the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family that have been primarily associated with B cells. CD40 enhanced proliferation, whereas B cell–activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) and transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) promoted cytotoxicity. These functions were enhanced relative to clinical benchmarks after prolonged antigen stimulation, and CAR T cell signaling through these domains fell into distinct states of memory, cytotoxicity, and metabolism. BAFF-R CAR T cells were enriched for a highly cytotoxic transcriptional signature previously associated with positive clinical outcomes. We also observed that replacing the 4-1BB intracellular signaling domain with the BAFF-R signaling domain in a clinically validated B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)–specific CAR resulted in enhanced activity in a xenotransplant model of multiple myeloma. Together, these results show that CAR Pooling is a general approach for rapid exploration of CAR architecture and activity to improve the efficacy of CAR T cell therapies.},

However, DNA synthesis and sequencing errors confound the correct interpretation of observed barcodes and can lead to significant data loss or spurious results. Widely used error-correcting codes borrowed from computer science (e.g., Hamming, Levenshtein codes) do not properly account for insertions and deletions (indels) in DNA barcodes, even though deletions are the most common type of synthesis error. Here, we present and experimentally validate filled/truncated right end edit (FREE) barcodes, which correct substitution, insertion, and deletion errors, even when these errors alter the barcode length. FREE barcodes are designed with experimental considerations in mind, including balanced guanine-cytosine (GC) content, minimal homopolymer runs, and reduced internal hairpin propensity. We generate and include lists of barcodes with different lengths and error correction levels that may be useful in diverse high-throughput applications, including {\textgreater}106 single-error–correcting 16-mers that strike a balance between decoding accuracy, barcode length, and library size. Moreover, concatenating two or more FREE codes into a single barcode increases the available barcode space combinatorially, generating lists with {\textgreater}1015 error-correcting barcodes. The included software for creating barcode libraries and decoding sequenced barcodes is efficient and designed to be user-friendly for the general biology community.},

We demonstrate that the composability of our design scheme enables model-guided tuning of circuit function and the ability to make diverse network connections; synthetic phosphorylation circuits can be coupled to upstream cell surface receptors to enable fast-timescale sensing of extracellular ligands, while downstream connections can regulate gene expression. We leverage these capabilities to engineer cell-based cytokine controllers that dynamically sense and suppress activated T cells.

	abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (collectively, IDRs) are pervasive across proteomes in all kingdoms of life, help to shape biological functions and are involved in numerous diseases. IDRs populate a diverse set of transiently formed structures and defy conventional sequence–structure–function relationships1. Developments in protein science have made it possible to predict the three-dimensional structures of folded proteins at the proteome scale2. By contrast, there is a lack of knowledge about the conformational properties of IDRs, partly because the sequences of disordered proteins are poorly conserved and also because only a few of these proteins have been characterized experimentally. The inability to predict structural properties of IDRs across the proteome has limited our understanding of the functional roles of IDRs and how evolution shapes them. As a supplement to previous structural studies of individual IDRs3, we developed an efficient molecular model to generate conformational ensembles of IDRs and thereby to predict their conformational properties from sequences4,5. Here we use this model to simulate nearly all of the IDRs in the human proteome. Examining conformational ensembles of 28,058 IDRs, we show how chain compaction is correlated with cellular function and localization. We provide insights into how sequence features relate to chain compaction and, using a machine-learning model trained on our simulation data, show the conservation of conformational properties across orthologues. Our results recapitulate observations from previous studies of individual protein systems and exemplify how to link—at the proteome scale—conformational ensembles with cellular function and localization, amino acid sequence, evolutionary conservation and disease variants. Our freely available database of conformational properties will encourage further experimental investigation and enable the generation of hypotheses about the biological roles and evolution of IDRs.},

It has been a long-standing goal in the field to decode the regulatory logic of an enhancer and to understand the details of how spatiotemporal gene expression is encoded in an enhancer sequence. Here we show that deep learning models2–6, can be used to efficiently design synthetic, cell-type-specific enhancers, starting from random sequences, and that this optimization process allows detailed tracing of enhancer features at single-nucleotide resolution. We evaluate the function of fully synthetic enhancers to specifically target Kenyon cells or glial cells in the fruit fly brain using transgenic animals. We further exploit enhancer design to create ‘dual-code’ enhancers that target two cell types and minimal enhancers smaller than 50 base pairs that are fully functional. By examining the state space searches towards local optima, we characterize enhancer codes through the strength, combination and arrangement of transcription factor activator and transcription factor repressor motifs. Finally, we apply the same strategies to successfully design human enhancers, which adhere to enhancer rules similar to those of Drosophila enhancers. Enhancer design guided by deep learning leads to better understanding of how enhancers work and shows that their code can be exploited to manipulate cell states.},

	abstract = {Tryptophan (Trp) holds a unique place in biology for a multitude of reasons. It is the largest of all twenty amino acids in the translational toolbox. Its side chain is indole, which is aromatic with a binuclear ring structure, whereas those of Phe, Tyr, and His are single-ring aromatics. In part due to these elaborate structural features, the biosynthetic pathway of Trp is the most complex and the most energy-consuming among all amino acids. Essential in the animal diet, Trp is also the least abundant amino acid in the cell, and one of the rarest in the proteome. In most eukaryotes, Trp is the only amino acid besides Met, which is coded for by a single codon, namely UGG. Due to the large and hydrophobic π-electron surface area, its aromatic side chain interacts with multiple other side chains in the protein, befitting its strategic locations in the protein structure. Finally, several Trp derivatives, namely tryptophylquinone, oxitriptan, serotonin, melatonin, and tryptophol, have specialized functions. Overall, Trp is a scarce and precious amino acid in the cell, such that nature uses it parsimoniously, for multiple but selective functions. Here, the various aspects of the uniqueness of Trp are presented in molecular terms.},

	abstract = {In proteins, the amino acids Phe, Tyr, and especially Trp are frequently involved in π interactions such as π–π, cation−π, and CH−π bonds. These interactions are often crucial for protein structure and protein–ligand binding. A powerful means to study these interactions is progressive fluorination of these aromatic residues to modulate the electrostatic component of the interaction. However, to date no protein expression platform is available to produce milligram amounts of proteins labeled with such fluorinated amino acids. Here, we present a Lactococcus lactis Trp auxotroph-based expression system for efficient incorporation (≥95\%) of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrafluorinated, as well as a methylated Trp analog. As a model protein we have chosen LmrR, a dimeric multidrug transcriptional repressor protein from L. lactis. LmrR binds aromatic drugs, like daunomycin and riboflavin, between Trp96 and Trp96′ in the dimer interface. Progressive fluorination of Trp96 decreased the affinity for the drugs 6- to 70-fold, clearly establishing the importance of electrostatic π–π interactions for drug binding. Presteady state kinetic data of the LmrR–drug interaction support the enthalpic nature of the interaction, while high resolution crystal structures of the labeled protein–drug complexes provide for the first time a structural view of the progressive fluorination approach. The L. lactis expression system was also used to study the role of Trp68 in the binding of riboflavin by the membrane-bound riboflavin transport protein RibU from L. lactis. Progressive fluorination of Trp68 revealed a strong electrostatic component that contributed 15–20\% to the total riboflavin-RibU binding energy.},

	abstract = {Steroid receptors activate gene transcription by recruiting coactivators to initiate transcription of their target genes. For most nuclear receptors, the ligand-dependent activation function domain-2 (AF-2) is a primary contributor to the nuclear receptor (NR) transcriptional activity. In contrast to other steroid receptors, such as ERα, the activation function of androgen receptor (AR) is largely dependent on its ligand-independent AF-1 located in its N-terminal domain (NTD). It remains unclear why AR utilizes a different AF domain from other receptors despite that NRs share similar domain organizations. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of DNA-bound full-length AR and its complex structure with key coactivators, SRC-3 and p300. AR dimerization follows a unique head-to-head and tail-to-tail manner. Unlike ERα, AR directly contacts a single SRC-3 and p300. The AR NTD is the primary site for coactivator recruitment. The structures provide a basis for understanding assembly of the AR:coactivator complex and its domain contributions for coactivator assembly and transcriptional regulation.},

	abstract = {Many eukaryotic proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that intersperse globular folded domains, in contrast with bacterial proteins which are typically highly globular1, 2. Recent years have seen great progress in identifying biological functions associated with these elusive protein sequence: in specific cases, they mediate liquid liquid phase separation3, perform molecular recognition4, or act as sensors to changes in the environment5. Nevertheless, only a small number of IDRs have annotated functions6 despite their presence in 64\% of yeast proteins,7 stimulating some to question what ‘general purpose’ they may serve8, 9. Here, by interrogating the refoldability of two fungal proteomes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurosporra crassa), we show that IDRs render their host proteins more refoldable from the denatured state, allowing them to cohere more closely to Anfinsen’s thermodynamic hypothesis10, 11. The data provide an exceptionally clear picture of which biophysical and topological characteristics enable refoldability. Moreover, we find that almost all yeast proteins that partition into stress granules during heat shock are refoldable, a finding that holds for other condensates such as P-bodies and the nucleolus. Finally, we find that the Hsp104 unfoldase12 is the principal actor in mediating disassembly of heat stress granules and that the efficiency with which condensed proteins are returned to the soluble phase is also well explained by refoldability. Hence, these studies establish spontaneous refoldability as an adaptive trait that endows proteins with the capacity to reform their native soluble structures following their extraction from condensates. Altogether, our results provide an intuitive model for the function of IDRs in many multidomain proteins and clarifies their relationship to the phenomenon of biomolecular condensation.},

	abstract = {When nature maintains or evolves a gene’s function over millions of years at scale, it produces a diversity of homologous sequences whose patterns of conservation and change contain rich structural, functional, and historical information about the gene. However, natural gene diversity likely excludes vast regions of functional sequence space and includes phylogenetic and evolutionary eccentricities, limiting what information we can extract. We introduce an accessible experimental approach for compressing long-term gene evolution to laboratory timescales, allowing for the direct observation of extensive adaptation and divergence followed by inference of structural, functional, and environmental constraints for any selectable gene. To enable this approach, we developed a new orthogonal DNA replication (OrthoRep) system that durably hypermutates chosen genes at a rate of {\textgreater}10−4 substitutions per base in vivo. When OrthoRep was used to evolve a conditionally essential maladapted enzyme, we obtained thousands of unique multi-mutation sequences with many pairs {\textgreater}60 amino acids apart ({\textgreater}15\% divergence), revealing known and new factors influencing enzyme adaptation. The fitness of evolved sequences was not predictable by advanced machine learning models trained on natural variation. We suggest that OrthoRep supports the prospective and systematic discovery of constraints shaping gene evolution, uncovering of new regions in fitness landscapes, and general applications in biomolecular engineering.},

At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage.

To address this, we develop the next-generation bacterial two-hybrid (NGB2H) method, which allows for the rapid exploration of interactions of programmed protein libraries in a quantitative and scalable way using next-generation sequencing readout. We design, build, and test large sets of orthogonal synthetic coiled-coils, assayed over 8,000 PPIs, and used the dataset to train a more accurate coiled-coil scoring algorithm (iCipa). After characterizing nearly 18,000 new PPIs, we identify to the best of our knowledge the largest set of orthogonal coiled-coils to date, with fifteen on-target interactions.

The result is a highly detailed scheme that describes the placements of all amino acids in the standard genetic code. The model describes evolution of 6-, 4-, 3-, 2- and 1-codon sectors. Innovation in column 3 of the code is explained. Wobbling and code degeneracy are explained. Separate distribution of serine sectors between columns 2 and 4 of the code is described. We conclude that very little chaos contributed to evolution of the genetic code and that the pattern of evolution of aaRS enzymes describes a history of the evolution of the code. A model is proposed to describe the biological selection for the earliest evolution of the code and for protocell evolution.},

	abstract = {Among the 20 amino acids, three of them—leucine (Leu), arginine (Arg), and serine (Ser)—are encoded by six different codons. In comparison, all of the other 17 amino acids are encoded by either 4, 3, 2, or 1 codon. Peculiarly, Ser is separated into two disparate Ser codon boxes, differing by at least two-base substitutions, in contrast to Leu and Arg, of which codons are mutually exchangeable by a single-base substitution. We propose that these two different Ser codons independently emerged during evolution. In this hypothesis, at the time of the origin of life there were only seven primordial amino acids: Valine (coded by GUX [X = U, C, A or G]), alanine (coded by GCX), aspartic acid (coded by GAY [Y = U or C]), glutamic acid (coded by GAZ [Z = A or G]), glycine (coded by GGX), Ser (coded by AGY), and Arg (coded by CGX and AGZ). All of these were derived from GGX for glycine by single-base substitutions. Later in evolution, another class of Ser codons, UCX, were derived from alanine codons, GCX, distinctly different from the other primordial Ser codon, AGY. From the analysis of the Escherichia coli genome, we find extensive disparities in the usage of these two Ser codons, as some genes use only AGY for Ser in their genes. In contrast, others use only UCX, pointing to distinct differences in their origins, consistent with our hypothesis.},

	abstract = {The standard genetic code (SGC) is virtually universal among extant life forms. Although many deviations from the universal code exist, particularly in organelles and prokaryotes with small genomes, they are limited in scope and obviously secondary. The universality of the code likely results from the combination of a frozen accident, i.e., the deleterious effect of codon reassignment in the SGC, and the inhibitory effect of changes in the code on horizontal gene transfer. The structure of the SGC is nonrandom and ensures high robustness of the code to mutational and translational errors. However, this error minimization is most likely a by-product of the primordial code expansion driven by the diversification of the repertoire of protein amino acids, rather than a direct result of selection. Phylogenetic analysis of translation system components, in particular aminoacyl–tRNA synthetases, shows that, at a stage of evolution when the translation system had already attained high fidelity, the correspondence between amino acids and cognate codons was determined by recognition of amino acids by RNA molecules, i.e., proto-tRNAs. We propose an experimentally testable scenario for the evolution of the code that combines recognition of amino acids by unique sites on proto-tRNAs (distinct from the anticodons), expansion of the code via proto-tRNA duplication, and frozen accident.},

	abstract = {The genetic code is nearly universal, and the arrangement of the codons in the standard codon table is highly non-random. The three main concepts on the origin and evolution of the code are the stereochemical theory, according to which codon assignments are dictated by physico-chemical affinity between amino acids and the cognate codons (anticodons); the coevolution theory, which posits that the code structure coevolved with amino acid biosynthesis pathways; and the error minimization theory under which selection to minimize the adverse effect of point mutations and translation errors was the principal factor of the code’s evolution. These theories are not mutually exclusive and are also compatible with the frozen accident hypothesis, i.e., the notion that the standard code might have no special properties but was fixed simply because all extant life forms share a common ancestor, with subsequent changes to the code, mostly, precluded by the deleterious effect of codon reassignment. Mathematical analysis of the structure and possible evolutionary trajectories of the code shows that it is highly robust to translational misreading but there are numerous more robust codes, so the standard code potentially could evolve from a random code via a short sequence of codon series reassignments. Thus, much of the evolution that led to the standard code could be a combination of frozen accident with selection for error minimization although contributions from coevolution of the code with metabolic pathways and weak affinities between amino acids and nucleotide triplets cannot be ruled out. However, such scenarios for the code evolution are based on formal schemes whose relevance to the actual primordial evolution is uncertain. A real understanding of the code origin and evolution is likely to be attainable only in conjunction with a credible scenario for the evolution of the coding principle itself and the translation system.},

	abstract = {Mutagenesis of protein-encoding sequences occurs ubiquitously; it enables evolution, accumulates during aging, and is associated with disease. Many biotechnological methods exploit random mutations to evolve novel proteins. To quantitate protein tolerance to random change, it is vital to understand the probability that a random amino acid replacement will lead to a protein's functional inactivation. We define this probability as the “x factor.” Here, we develop a broadly applicable approach to calculate x factors and demonstrate this method using the human DNA repair enzyme 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG). Three gene-wide mutagenesis libraries were created, each with 105 diversity and averaging 2.2, 4.6, and 6.2 random amino acid changes per mutant. After determining the percentage of functional mutants in each library using high-stringency selection ({\textgreater}19,000-fold), the x factor was found to be 34\% ± 6\%. Remarkably, reanalysis of data from studies of diverse proteins reveals similar inactivation probabilities. To delineate the nature of tolerated amino acid substitutions, we sequenced 244 surviving AAG mutants. The 920 tolerated substitutions were characterized by substitutability index and mapped onto the AAG primary, secondary, and known tertiary structures. Evolutionarily conserved residues show low substitutability indices. In AAG, β strands are on average less substitutable than α helices; and surface loops that are not involved in DNA binding are the most substitutable. Our results are relevant to such diverse topics as applied molecular evolution, the rate of introduction of deleterious alleles into genomes in evolutionary history, and organisms' tolerance of mutational burden.},

	abstract = {Why is an amino acid replacement in a protein accepted during evolution? The answer given by bioinformatics relies on the frequency of change of each amino acid by another one and the propensity of each to remain unchanged. We propose that these replacement rules are recoverable from the secondary structural trends of amino acids. A distance measure between high-resolution Ramachandran distributions reveals that structurally similar residues coincide with those found in substitution matrices such as BLOSUM: Asn ↔ Asp, Phe ↔ Tyr, Lys ↔ Arg, Gln ↔ Glu, Ile ↔ Val, Met → Leu; with Ala, Cys, His, Gly, Ser, Pro, and Thr, as structurally idiosyncratic residues. We also found a high average correlation (\$\${\textbackslash}overline\{R\}\$\$ = 0.85) between thirty amino acid mutability scales and the mutational inertia (IX), which measures the energetic cost weighted by the number of observations at the most probable amino acid conformation. These results indicate that amino acid substitutions follow two optimally-efficient principles: (a) amino acids interchangeability privileges their secondary structural similarity, and (b) the amino acid mutability depends directly on its biosynthetic energy cost, and inversely with its frequency. These two principles are the underlying rules governing the observed amino acid substitutions.},

	abstract = {Gene regulation in multicellular eukaryotes is complex, with many layers of regulation. Two fundamental mechanisms of gene regulation involve transcription factors and microRNAs, a large class of small, non-coding RNAs.It is widely believed that phenotypic evolution is closely linked to the evolution of gene regulation. To begin to understand the evolution of gene regulatory networks, it is important to first understand how the individual regulators and their regulatory interactions evolve.A combination of computational and experimental work has made it possible to begin to compare the evolution of transcriptional regulation with post-transcriptional regulation that is carried out by microRNAs.For both transcription factors and microRNAs, the regulators themselves seem to be well conserved over large evolutionary distances, whereas their targets seem to have evolved much more quickly, indicating that large-scale rewiring of regulatory networks has taken place in the course of evolution.In animal evolution, the acquisition of new microRNA families seems to have been much more rapid than the acquisition of new transcription-factor families. Several authors have proposed that new microRNA families have had important roles in the development of novel tissue types and organs.Ultimately, a comprehensive picture of gene-regulation evolution will require a unification of different regulatory mechanisms. As an initial step in this direction, we suggest a simple model that describes the transcription of new microRNA genes. A corollary of this model is that many microRNAs that are expressed at low levels and in specific spatio-temporal domains might have little biological function in regulating target genes in trans.},

We show that this divergence results primarily from variations outside the DNA-binding domains (DBDs), while DBD preferences remain largely conserved. Analysis of non-WGD orthologs revealed uneven splitting of ancestral preferences between duplicates, and the preferential acquiring of new targets by the least conserved paralog (biased neo/sub-functionalization). Interactions between paralogs were rare, and, when present, occurred through weak competition for DNA-binding or dependency between dimer-forming paralogs.

We traced the origin and expansion of all known TFs through the eukaryotic tree of life, using the broadest possible taxon sampling and an updated phylogenetic background. Our results show that the most complex multicellular lineages (i.e., those with embryonic development, Metazoa and Embryophyta) have the most complex TF repertoires, and that these repertoires were assembled in a stepwise manner. We also show that a significant part of the metazoan and embryophyte TF toolkits evolved earlier, in their respective unicellular ancestors. To gain insights into the role of TFs in the development of both embryophytes and metazoans, we analyzed TF expression patterns throughout their ontogeny. The expression patterns observed in both groups recapitulate those of the whole transcriptome, but reveal some important differences. Our comparative genomics and expression data reshape our view on how TFs contributed to eukaryotic evolution and reveal the importance of TFs to the origins of multicellularity and embryonic development.},

Recent studies identified several tardigrade-unique proteins as protective factors of biomolecules from extreme stresses. Due to the limitation of the technique available in tardigrades, the function of these protective molecules has largely been studied utilizing the systems of in vitro and the heterologous expression in other organisms. Although RNAi is feasible in tardigrades, their effects are variable and not always sufficient. To analyze the functions of the tardigrade protective proteins, in vivo genetic manipulations have been desired. In this study, we used a tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris as a model whose genome is available, and developed the delivery method of Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to adult tardigrade cells. Cas9 RNPs containing two kinds of crRNAs were injected to the body cavity of adult tardigrades and subjected to the subsequent electroporation to facilitate the incorporation of RNPs to the cells. Using this delivery method, we detected the deletion of the intervening region between two crRNAs from the genome. Intriguingly, all examined joining sites exhibited no incorporation of insertions/deletions (indels), suggesting that no-indel end-joining is dominant repair system in this tardigrade. We also detected similar removal of the intervening region even in the tardigrades injected with Cas9 RNPs without electroporation and in this case the no-indel end-joining is detected in still dominant but not all examined joining sites. This study provides the development of the delivery method of Cas9 RNPs to tardigrade cells and our data also suggested that simultaneous application of more than two crRNAs/gRNAs are recommended to disrupt the target gene by CRISPR/Cas9 system to avoid scarless repair in the tardigrade.},

	abstract = {Experimentally tractable organisms like C. elegans, Drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse are popular models for addressing diverse questions in biology. In 1997, two of the most valuable invertebrate model organisms to date—C. elegans and Drosophila—were found to be much more closely related to each other than expected. C. elegans and Drosophila belong to the nematodes and arthropods, respectively, and these two phyla and six other phyla make up a clade of molting animals referred to as the Ecdysozoa. The other ecdysozoan phyla could be valuable models for comparative biology, taking advantage of the rich and continual sources of research findings as well as tools from both C. elegans and Drosophila. But when the Ecdysozoa was first recognized, few tools were available for laboratory studies in any of these six other ecdysozoan phyla. In 1999 I began an effort to develop tools for studying one such phylum, the tardigrades. Here, I describe how the tardigrade species Hypsibius exemplaris and tardigrades more generally have emerged over the past two decades as valuable new models for answering diverse questions. To date, these questions have included how animal body plans evolve and how biological materials can survive some remarkably extreme conditions.},

In this article, we establish a usable terminology for the decomposition of a sequence collection in terms of the lipogram. Next, we characterize Uniref50 using a lipogram decomposition. At the global level, protein lipograms exhibit power-law properties. A clear correlation with metabolic cost is seen. Finally, we use the lipogram construction to assign proteomes to the four branches of the tree-of-life: archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes and viruses. We conclude from this pilot study that the lipogram demonstrates considerable potential as an additional tool for sequence analysis and proteome classification.},

Many theories for the order in which amino acids were integrated into the code have been proposed, considering factors ranging from prebiotic chemistry to codon capture. Several meta-analyses combined these theories to yield a feasible consensus chronology of the genetic code's evolution, but there is a dearth of experimental data to test the hypothesised order. We used combinatorial chemistry to synthesise libraries of random polypeptides that were based on different subsets of the 20 standard amino acids, thus representing different stages of a plausible history of the alphabet. Four libraries were comprised of the five, nine, and 16 most ancient amino acids, and all 20 extant residues for a direct side-by-side comparison. We characterised numerous variants from each library for their solubility and propensity to form secondary, tertiary or quaternary structures. Proteins from the two most ancient libraries were more likely to be soluble than those from the extant library. Several individual protein variants exhibited inducible protein folding and other traits typical of intrinsically disordered proteins. From these libraries, we can infer how primordial protein structure and function might have evolved with the genetic code.},

In contrast, the metabolism of the earliest cellular life forms was likely much simpler with only a few enzymes of comparatively low activity. It has been speculated that these early enzymes had low specificities and in turn were able to perform multiple functions. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Ferla et al. describe examples of enzymes that catalyze chemically distinct reactions while using the same active site. Most importantly, the authors demonstrated that the comparatively weak activities of these multifunctional enzymes are each physiologically relevant. These findings contrast with simply promiscuous enzyme activities, which have been described numerous times but are not physiologically relevant. Ferla et al. elegantly combined initial bioinformatics searches for enzyme candidates with sound kinetic measurements, evolutionary considerations and even structural discussions. The phenomenon of multifunctionality appears to be a mechanism for bacteria with reduced genomes to compensate for their lack of certain enzymes. In the broader context of evolution, these organisms could be considered living model systems to study features of long-extinct early cellular life.},

Before the emergence of biosynthetic pathways, this set is the most plausible resource for protein formation (i.e., proteogenesis) within the overall process of abiogenesis. An essential unsolved question regarding this prebiotic set is whether it defines a “foldable set”—that is, does it contain sufficient chemical information to permit cooperatively folding polypeptides? If so, what (if any) characteristic properties might such polypeptides exhibit? To investigate these questions, two “primitive” versions of an extant protein fold (the β-trefoil) were produced by top-down symmetric deconstruction, resulting in a reduced alphabet size of 12 or 13 amino acids and a percentage of prebiotic amino acids approaching 80\%. These proteins show a substantial acidification of pI and require high salt concentrations for cooperative folding. The results suggest that the prebiotic amino acids do comprise a foldable set within the halophile environment.},

Of the tested SNP sequences, 547 were located in glucocorticoid-responsive regulatory elements of which 233 showed allele-dependent activity. Transcripts regulated by these functional variants were enriched for those differentially expressed in psychiatric disorders in the postmortem brain. Phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis in 4,439 phenotypes revealed potentially causal associations specifically in neurobehavioral traits, including major depression and other psychiatric disorders. Finally, a functional gene score derived from these variants was significantly associated with differences in the physiological stress response, suggesting that these variants may alter disease risk by moderating the individual set point of the stress response.},

We perform a systematic analysis of transfer learning using PLMs, conducting 370 experiments across a comprehensive suite of factors including different downstream tasks, architectures, model sizes, model depths, and pretraining time. We observe that while almost all downstream tasks do benefit from pretrained models compared to naive sequence representations, for the majority of tasks performance does not scale with pretraining, and instead relies on low-level features learned early in pretraining. Our results point to a mismatch between current PLM pretraining paradigms and most applications of these models, indicating a need for better pretraining methods.},

Here I show—based on identification and phylogenetic analysis of steroid receptors in basal vertebrates and reconstruction of the sequences and functional attributes of ancestral proteins—that the first steroid receptor was an estrogen receptor, followed by a progesterone receptor. Genome mapping and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the full complement of mammalian steroid receptors evolved from these ancient receptors by two large-scale genome expansions, one before the advent of jawed vertebrates and one after. Specific regulation of physiological processes by androgens and corticoids are relatively recent innovations that emerged after these duplications. These findings support a model of ligand exploitation in which the terminal ligand in a biosynthetic pathway is the first for which a receptor evolves; selection for this hormone also selects for the synthesis of intermediates despite the absence of receptors, and duplicated receptors then evolve affinity for these substances. In this way, novel hormone-receptor pairs are created, and an integrated system of increasing complexity elaborated. This model suggests that ligands for some “orphan” receptors may be found among intermediates in the synthesis of ligands for phylogenetically related receptors.},

Here we demonstrate how an integrated molecular system—the specific functional interaction between the steroid hormone aldosterone and its partner the mineralocorticoid receptor—evolved by a stepwise Darwinian process. Using ancestral gene resurrection, we show that, long before the hormone evolved, the receptor's affinity for aldosterone was present as a structural by-product of its partnership with chemically similar, more ancient ligands. Introducing two amino acid changes into the ancestral sequence recapitulates the evolution of present-day receptor specificity. Our results indicate that tight interactions can evolve by molecular exploitation—recruitment of an older molecule, previously constrained for a different role, into a new functional complex.},

To address this question, we experimentally measured how the fitness effects of historical sequence substitutions changed during the billion-year evolutionary history of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) ATPase domain beginning from a deep eukaryotic ancestor to modern Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found a pervasive influence of epistasis. Of 98 derived amino acid states that evolved along this lineage, about half compromise fitness when introduced into the reconstructed ancestral Hsp90. And the vast majority of ancestral states reduce fitness when introduced into the extant S. cerevisiae Hsp90. Overall, more than 75\% of historical substitutions were contingent on permissive substitutions that rendered the derived state nondeleterious, became entrenched by subsequent restrictive substitutions that made the ancestral state deleterious, or both. This epistasis was primarily caused by specific interactions among sites rather than a general effect on the protein’s tolerance to mutation. Our results show that epistasis continually opened and closed windows of mutational opportunity over evolutionary timescales, producing histories and biological states that reflect the transient internal constraints imposed by the protein’s fleeting sequence states.},

	abstract = {Much recent work has explored molecular and population-genetic constraints on the rate of protein sequence evolution. The best predictor of evolutionary rate is expression level, for reasons that have remained unexplained. Here, we hypothesize that selection to reduce the burden of protein misfolding will favor protein sequences with increased robustness to translational missense errors. Pressure for translational robustness increases with expression level and constrains sequence evolution. Using several sequenced yeast genomes, global expression and protein abundance data, and sets of paralogs traceable to an ancient whole-genome duplication in yeast, we rule out several confounding effects and show that expression level explains roughly half the variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein evolutionary rates. We examine causes for expression's dominant role and find that genome-wide tests favor the translational robustness explanation over existing hypotheses that invoke constraints on function or translational efficiency. Our results suggest that proteins evolve at rates largely unrelated to their functions and can explain why highly expressed proteins evolve slowly across the tree of life.},

Our theory also predicts that a protein can gain extra robustness to the first few substitutions by increasing its thermodynamic stability. We validate our theory with simulations on lattice protein models and by showing that it quantitatively predicts previously published experimental measurements on subtilisin and our own measurements on variants of TEM1 β-lactamase.

Here we apply a unique experimental system to investigate evolutionary reproducibility and path dependence at the protein level. We combined phage-assisted continuous evolution with high-throughput sequencing to analyze evolving protein populations as they adapted to divergent and then convergent selection pressures over hundreds of generations. Independent populations of T7 RNA polymerase genes were subjected to one of two selection histories (“pathways”) demanding recognition of distinct intermediate promoters followed by a common final promoter. We observed distinct classes of solutions with unequal phenotypic activity and evolutionary potential evolve from the two pathways, as well as from replicate populations exposed to identical selection conditions. Mutational analysis revealed specific epistatic interactions that explained the observed path dependence and irreproducibility. Our results reveal in molecular detail how protein adaptation to different environments, as well as stochasticity among populations evolved in the same environment, can both generate evolutionary outcomes that preclude subsequent convergence.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary trajectories are deemed largely irreversible. In a newly diverged protein, reversion of mutations that led to the functional switch typically results in loss of both the new and the ancestral functions. Nonetheless, evolutionary transitions where reversions are viable have also been described. The structural and mechanistic causes of reversion compatibility versus incompatibility therefore remain unclear. We examined two laboratory evolution trajectories of mammalian paraoxonase-1, a lactonase with promiscuous organophosphate hydrolase (OPH) activity. Both trajectories began with the same active-site mutant, His115Trp, which lost the native lactonase activity and acquired higher OPH activity. A neo-functionalization trajectory amplified the promiscuous OPH activity, whereas the re-functionalization trajectory restored the native activity, thus generating a new lactonase that lacks His115. The His115 revertants of these trajectories indicated opposite trends. Revertants of the neo-functionalization trajectory lost both the evolved OPH and the original lactonase activity. Revertants of the trajectory that restored the original lactonase function were, however, fully active. Crystal structures and molecular simulations show that in the newly diverged OPH, the reverted His115 and other catalytic residues are displaced, thus causing loss of both the original and the new activity. In contrast, in the re-functionalization trajectory, reversion compatibility of the original lactonase activity derives from mechanistic versatility whereby multiple residues can fulfill the same task. This versatility enables unique sequence-reversible compositions that are inaccessible when the active site was repurposed toward a new function.},

	abstract = {Many cellular functions depend on highly specific intermolecular interactions, for example transcription factors and their DNA binding sites, microRNAs and their RNA binding sites, the interfaces between heterodimeric protein molecules, the stems in RNA molecules, and kinases and their response regulators in signal-transduction systems. Despite the need for complementarity between interacting partners, such pairwise systems seem to be capable of high levels of evolutionary divergence, even when subject to strong selection. Such behavior is a consequence of the diminishing advantages of increasing binding affinity between partners, the multiplicity of evolutionary pathways between selectively equivalent alternatives, and the stochastic nature of evolutionary processes. Because mutation pressure toward reduced affinity conflicts with selective pressure for greater interaction, situations can arise in which the expected distribution of the degree of matching between interacting partners is bimodal, even in the face of constant selection. Although biomolecules with larger numbers of interacting partners are subject to increased levels of evolutionary conservation, their more numerous partners need not converge on a single sequence motif or be increasingly constrained in more complex systems. These results suggest that most phylogenetic differences in the sequences of binding interfaces are not the result of adaptive fine tuning but a simple consequence of random genetic drift.},

	abstract = {Proteins display generic properties that are challenging to explain by direct selection, notably allostery, the capacity to be regulated through long-range effects, and evolvability, the capacity to adapt to new selective pressures. An evolutionary scenario is proposed where proteins acquire these two features indirectly as a by-product of their selection for a more fundamental property, exquisite discrimination, the capacity to bind discriminatively very similar ligands. Achieving this task is shown to typically require proteins to undergo a conformational change. We argue that physical and evolutionary constraints impel this change to be controlled by a group of sites extending from the binding site. Proteins can thus acquire a latent potential for allosteric regulation and evolutionary adaptation because of long-range effects that initially arise as evolutionary spandrels. This scenario accounts for the groups of conserved and coevolving residues observed in multiple sequence alignments. However, we propose that most pairs of coevolving and contacting residues inferred from such alignments have a different origin, related to thermal stability. A physical model is presented that illustrates this evolutionary scenario and its implications. The scenario can be implemented in experiments of protein evolution to directly test its predictions.},

However, many nonproteinogenic AAs were also prebiotically available, which begs two fundamental questions: Why do we have the current modern amino acid alphabet and would proteins be able to fold into globular structures as well if different amino acids comprised the genetic code? Here, we experimentally evaluate the solubility and secondary structure propensities of several prebiotically relevant amino acids in the context of synthetic combinatorial 25-mer peptide libraries. The most prebiotically abundant linear aliphatic and basic residues were incorporated along with or in place of other early amino acids to explore these alternative sequence spaces. The results show that foldability was likely a critical factor in the selection of the canonical alphabet. Unbranched aliphatic amino acids were purged from the proteinogenic alphabet despite their high prebiotic abundance because they generate polypeptides that are oversolubilized and have low packing efficiency. Surprisingly, we find that the inclusion of a short-chain basic amino acid also decreases polypeptides’ secondary structure potential, for which we suggest a biophysical model. Our results support the view that, despite lacking basic residues, the early canonical alphabet was remarkably adaptive at supporting protein folding and explain why basic residues were only incorporated at a later stage of protein evolution.},

This method, which we denote splicing-linked expression design (SLED), can be combined in a Boolean manner with existing techniques such as minipromoters and viral capsids. SLED can use strong constitutive promoters, without sacrificing precision, by decoupling the tradeoff between promoter strength and selectivity. AAV-packaged SLED vectors can selectively deliver fluorescent reporters and calcium indicators to various neuronal subtypes in vivo. We also demonstrate gene therapy utility by creating SLED vectors that can target PRPH2 and SF3B1 mutations.

This model has been built upon the characterization of the GRdim mutant, reported to be incapable of DNA binding and dimerization. Although quantitative live-cell imaging data shows GRdim as mostly dimeric, genomic studies based on recovery of enriched half-site response elements suggest monomeric engagement on DNA. Here, we perform genome-wide studies on GRdim and a constitutively monomeric mutant. Our results show that impairing dimerization affects binding even to open chromatin. We also find that GRdim does not exclusively bind half-response elements. Our results do not support a physiological role for monomeric GR and are consistent with a common mode of receptor binding via higher order structures that drives both the activating and repressive actions of glucocorticoids.},

While mutations of the AR protein have been extensively studied, little is known about those somatic mutations that occur at the non-coding regions where AR binds DNA. Using clinical whole genome sequencing, we show that AR binding sites have a dramatically increased rate of mutations that is greater than any other transcription factor and specific to only prostate cancer. Demonstrating this may be common to lineage-specific transcription factors, estrogen receptor binding sites were also found to have elevated rate of mutations in breast cancer. We provide evidence that these mutations at AR binding sites, and likely other related transcription factors, are caused by faulty repair of abasic sites. Overall, this work demonstrates that non-coding AR binding sites are frequently mutated in prostate cancer and can impact enhancer activity.},

	abstract = {Steroid receptors bind as dimers to a degenerate set of response elements containing inverted repeats of a hexameric half-site separated by 3 bp of spacer (IR3). Naturally occurring selective androgen response elements have recently been identified that resemble direct repeats of the hexameric half-site (ADR3). The 3D crystal structure of the androgen receptor (AR) DNA-binding domain bound to a selective ADR3 reveals an unexpected head-to-head arrangement of the two protomers rather than the expected head-to-tail arrangement seen in nuclear receptors bound to response elements of similar geometry. Compared with the glucocorticoid receptor, the DNA-binding domain dimer interface of the AR has additional interactions that stabilize the AR dimer and increase the affinity for nonconsensus response elements. This increased interfacial stability compared with the other steroid receptors may account for the selective binding of AR to ADR3 response elements.},

	abstract = {Background Progesterone, via its nuclear receptor (PR), exerts an overall tumorigenic effect on both uterine fibroid (leiomyoma) and breast cancer tissues, whereas the antiprogestin RU486 inhibits growth of these tissues through an unknown mechanism. Here, we determined the interaction between common or cell-specific genome-wide binding sites of PR and mRNA expression in RU486-treated uterine leiomyoma and breast cancer cells. Principal Findings ChIP-sequencing revealed 31,457 and 7,034 PR-binding sites in breast cancer and uterine leiomyoma cells, respectively; 1,035 sites overlapped in both cell types. Based on the chromatin-PR interaction in both cell types, we statistically refined the consensus progesterone response element to G•ACA• • •TGT•C. We identified two striking differences between uterine leiomyoma and breast cancer cells. First, the cis-regulatory elements for HSF, TEF-1, and C/EBPα and β were statistically enriched at genomic RU486/PR-targets in uterine leiomyoma, whereas E2F, FOXO1, FOXA1, and FOXF sites were preferentially enriched in breast cancer cells. Second, 51.5\% of RU486-regulated genes in breast cancer cells but only 6.6\% of RU486-regulated genes in uterine leiomyoma cells contained a PR-binding site within 5 kb from their transcription start sites (TSSs), whereas 75.4\% of RU486-regulated genes contained a PR-binding site farther than 50 kb from their TSSs in uterine leiomyoma cells. RU486 regulated only seven mRNAs in both cell types. Among these, adipophilin (PLIN2), a pro-differentiation gene, was induced via RU486 and PR via the same regulatory region in both cell types. Conclusions Our studies have identified molecular components in a RU486/PR-controlled gene network involved in the regulation of cell growth, cell migration, and extracellular matrix function. Tissue-specific and common patterns of genome-wide PR binding and gene regulation may determine the therapeutic effects of antiprogestins in uterine fibroids and breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Progesterone receptors (PRs) recognize and bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. To define the sequence-specific determinants of PR binding to DNA, we employed a detailed series of target elements and analyzed both PR binding in vitro and PR-mediated activation of a reporter gene in vivo. These elements represent point substitution or insertion mutants of a progesterone response element derived from the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). Substitution of a G for the first T in the 15-base pair (bp) MMTV progesterone response element core sequence, GTTACAAACTGTTCT, increases PR-DNA binding in vitro. All other tested mutations within this sequence either had no effect or decreased PR binding. From these analyses, we infer an optimal PR recognition sequence, -7RGNACANRNTGTNCY+7, composed of hexameric half-sites separated by precisely 3 bp and exhibiting dyad symmetry. Limited substitution of a suboptimal base for an optimal base, as in the wild type MMTV element, can be tolerated, but further suboptimal substitutions significantly decrease binding by PR. The identity of 1 bp within the hexameric half-site, position +/- 5, is unconstrained. Transition mutations, but not transversions, are permitted at position +/- 7. Here the hydrogen bond acceptor of the N-7 position of the purine ring may be involved in receptor recognition, since this feature is shared by the permitted substitutions. Insertion of a single base pair between the half-sites abolishes detectable binding, suggesting that the spatial orientation of the DNA binding domains of the monomeric receptor subunits are fixed by dimerization of the receptor. This pattern of sequence-specific recognition parallels that previously inferred for the glucocorticoid receptor, indicating that the two receptors may be unable to distinguish individual target sites. Each of the mutant response elements was also assessed for its ability to confer progestin responsiveness to a truncated MMTV promoter when introduced into a PR-containing cell line. Elements exhibiting strong receptor binding in vitro were fully inducible, whereas poorly inducible or uninducible elements displayed little or no recognition by receptor in vitro. However, some elements, though poorly bound in vitro, still activated transcription in vivo in response to hormone. In certain cases activation was as good as that seen with the wild type element. Further examination of in vitro receptor binding by this class of mutant elements using higher levels of baculovirus-expressed receptor revealed that many were indeed recognized by receptor, albeit with a lower affinity than the wild type sequence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Glucocorticoids elicit a variety of biological responses in skeletal muscle, including inhibiting protein synthesis and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and promoting proteolysis. Thus, excess or chronic glucocorticoid exposure leads to muscle atrophy and insulin resistance. Glucocorticoids propagate their signal mainly through glucocorticoid receptors (GR), which, upon binding to ligands, translocate to the nucleus and bind to genomic glucocorticoid response elements to regulate the transcription of nearby genes. Using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and microarray analysis, we identified 173 genes in mouse C2C12 myotubes. The mouse genome contains GR-binding regions in or near these genes, and gene expression is regulated by glucocorticoids. Eight of these genes encode proteins known to regulate distinct signaling events in insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 pathways. We found that overexpression of p85α, one of these eight genes, caused a decrease in C2C12 myotube diameters, mimicking the effect of glucocorticoids. Moreover, reducing p85α expression by RNA interference in C2C12 myotubes significantly compromised the ability of glucocorticoids to inhibit Akt and p70 S6 kinase activity and reduced glucocorticoid induction of insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation at serine 307. This phosphorylation is associated with insulin resistance. Furthermore, decreasing p85α expression abolished glucocorticoid inhibition of protein synthesis and compromised glucocorticoid-induced reduction of cell diameters in C2C12 myotubes. Finally, a glucocorticoid response element was identified in the p85α GR-binding regions. In summary, our studies identified GR-regulated transcriptional networks in myotubes and showed that p85α plays a critical role in glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance and muscle atrophy in C2C12 myotubes.},

A twenty amino-acid region constitutes a NR-specif ic signature and contains most of the conserved residues that stabilize the core of the canonical fold of NR LBDs. A common ligand-binding pocket, involving predominantly hydrophobic residues, is inferred by homology modelling of the human RXRα and glucocorticoid receptor ligand-binding sites according to the RARγ holo-LBD structure. Mutant studies support these models, as well as a general mechanism for ligand-induced activation deduced from the comparison of the transcriptionally active RARγ holo- and inactive RXRα apo-LBD structures.},

Since the completion of the Human Genome Project, millions of gene regulatory elements have been identified in the human genome. Understanding how each of those sites functionally contributes to gene regulation, however, remains a challenge for nearly every field of biology. Transcription factors influence cell function by interpreting information contained within cis-regulatory elements in chromatin. Whereas chromatin immunoprecipitation–sequencing has been used to identify and map transcription factor–DNA interactions, it has been difficult to assign functionality to the binding sites identified. Thus, in this study, we probed the transcriptional activity, DNA-binding competence, and functional activity of select nuclear receptor mutants in cellular and animal model systems and used this information to define the sequence constraints of functional steroid nuclear receptor cis-regulatory elements. Analysis of the architecture within sNR chromatin interacting sites revealed that only a small fraction of all sNR chromatin–interacting events is associated with transcriptional output and that this functionality is restricted to elements that vary from the consensus palindromic elements by one or two nucleotides. These findings define the transcriptional grammar necessary to predict functionality from regulatory sequences, with a multitude of future implications.},

The responsive sites were defined by direct GR binding via a GC response element (GRE) and exclusively increased reporter-gene expression. Meanwhile, most GBSs lacked GC-induced reporter activity. The non-responsive sites had epigenetic features of steady-state enhancers and clustered around direct GBSs. Together, our data support a model in which clusters of GBSs observed with ChIP-seq reflect interactions between direct and tethered GBSs over tens of kilobases. We further show that those interactions can synergistically modulate the activity of direct GBSs and may therefore play a major role in driving gene activation in response to GCs.},

Here we define a palindromic sequence of 15 base pairs, modelled after a sequence element shared by the vitellogenin genes of frog and chicken6, which confers oestrogen inducibility on a heterologous promoter and can be converted into a glucocorticoid-responsive element by substitution of one or two bases at homologous positions in the palindrome.

	abstract = {The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) associates with glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) and regulates selective gene transcription in a cell-specific manner. Native GREs are typically thought to be composite elements that recruit GR as well as other regulatory factors into functional complexes. We assessed whether GR occupancy is commonly a limiting determinant of GRE function as well as the extent to which core GR binding sequences and GRE architecture are conserved at functional loci. We surveyed 100-kb regions surrounding each of 548 known or potentially glucocorticoid-responsive genes in A549 human lung cells for GR-occupied GREs. We found that GR was bound in A549 cells predominately near genes responsive to glucocorticoids in those cells and not at genes regulated by GR in other cells. The GREs were positionally conserved at each responsive gene but across the set of responsive genes were distributed equally upstream and downstream of the transcription start sites, with 63\% of them {\textgreater}10 kb from those sites. Strikingly, although the core GR binding sequences across the set of GREs varied extensively around a consensus, the precise sequence at an individual GRE was conserved across four mammalian species. Similarly, sequences flanking the core GR binding sites also varied among GREs but were conserved at individual GREs. We conclude that GR occupancy is a primary determinant of glucocorticoid responsiveness in A549 cells and that core GR binding sequences as well as GRE architecture likely harbor gene-specific regulatory information.},

The unbiased sequence interrogation of the genuine chromatin binding sites suggests that direct ER binding requires the presence of Forkhead factor binding in close proximity.

Of particular interest is whether major shifts in protein function are caused by a few mutations of large effect and, if they are, the mechanisms that mediate these changes. Here we combine ancestral protein reconstruction with genetic manipulation and explicit studies of protein structure and dynamics to dissect an ancient and discrete shift in ligand specificity in the steroid receptors, a family of biologically essential hormone-controlled transcription factors. We previously found that the ancestor of the entire steroid receptor family was highly specific for estrogens, but its immediate phylogenetic descendant was sensitive only to androgens, progestogens, and corticosteroids. Here we show that this shift in function was driven primarily by two historical amino acid changes, which caused a ∼70,000-fold change in the ancestral protein’s specificity. These replacements subtly changed the chemistry of two amino acids, but they dramatically reduced estrogen sensitivity by introducing an excess of interaction partners into the receptor/estrogen complex, inducing a frustrated ensemble of suboptimal hydrogen bond networks unique to estrogens. This work shows how the protein’s architecture and dynamics shaped its evolution, amplifying a few biochemically subtle mutations into major shifts in the energetics and function of the protein.},

	abstract = {The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) DNA binding domain consists of several conserved amino acids and folds into two zinc finger-like structures. Previous trans-activation experiments indicated that three amino acids residing in this region, Gly, Ser and Val, appear to be critical for target-site discrimination. Based on the solved crystal structure, these residues are at the beginning of an amphipathic α-helix that interacts with the DNA's major groove; of these, only valine, however, contacts DNA. In order to examine their functional role directly, we have substituted these residues for the corresponding amino acids from the estrogen receptor (ER), overexpressed and purified the mutant proteins, and assayed their binding specificity and affinity by gel mobility shifts using glucocorticoid or estrogen response elements (GRE or ERE, respectively) as DNA probes. We find that all three residues are indeed required to fully switch GR's specificity to an ERE. The contacting valine in GR is of primary importance. The corresponding residue in ER, alanine, is less important for specificity, while glutamic acid, four amino acids towards the N-terminus, is most critical for ER discrimination. Finally, we show that the GR DNA binding domain carrying all three ER-specific mutations has a significantly higher affinity for an ERE than the ER DNA binding domain itself. We interpret these results in the context of both the data presented here and the crystal structure of the GR DNA binding domain complexed to a GRE.},

	abstract = {Expanding synthetic capabilities to routinely employ enzymes in organic solvents (OSs) is a dream for protein engineers and synthetic chemists. Despite significant advances in the field of protein engineering, general and transferable design principles to improve the OS resistance of enzymes are poorly understood. Herein, we report a combined computational and directed evolution study of Bacillus subtlis lipase A (BSLA) in three OSs (i. e., 1,4-dioxane, dimethyl sulfoxide, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol) to devise a rational strategy to guide engineering OS resistant enzymes. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that OSs reduce BSLA activity and resistance in OSs by (i) stripping off essential water molecules from the BLSA surface mainly through H-bonds binding; and (ii) penetrating the substrate binding cleft leading to inhibition and conformational change. Interestingly, integration of computational results with “BSLA-SSM” variant library (3439 variants; all natural diversity with amino acid exchange) revealed two complementary rational design strategies: (i) surface charge engineering, and (ii) substrate binding cleft engineering. These strategies are most likely applicable to stabilize other lipases and enzymes and assist experimentalists to design organic solvent resistant enzymes with reduced time and screening effort in lab experiments.},

This technology relies on the process of nonsense suppression, which is made possible by directing aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) to attach an ncAA onto a cognate suppressor tRNA. However, different mechanisms govern aaRS specificity toward its natural amino acid (AA) substrate and hinder the engineering of aaRSs for applications beyond the incorporation of a single l-α-AA. Directed evolution of aaRSs therefore faces two interlinked challenges: the removal of the affinity for cognate AA and improvement of ncAA acylation. Here we review aspects of AA recognition that directly influence the feasibility and success of aaRS engineering toward d- and β-AAs incorporation into proteins in vivo. Emerging directed evolution methods are described and evaluated on the basis of aaRS active site plasticity and its inherent constraints.},

To test this idea, we rationally designed 12 fusions between the naturally photoactive LOV2 domain from Avena sativa phototropin 1 and the Escherichia coli trp repressor. When illuminated, one of the fusions selectively binds operator DNA and protects it from nuclease digestion. The ready success of our rational design strategy suggests that the helical “allosteric lever arm” is a general scheme for coupling the function of two proteins.},

Upon binding a metal ion in the allosteric site, CueR switches into an activator conformation. It maintains all protein-DNA contacts but introduces torsional stresses that kink and undertwist the promoter, stabilizing an A-DNA-like conformation. These factors switch on and off transcription by exerting dynamic control of DNA stereochemistry, reshaping the core promoter and making it a better or worse substrate for polymerase.},

The most common prokaryotic signal transduction mechanisms are the one-component systems in which a single polypeptide contains both a sensory domain and a DNA-binding domain. Among the {\textgreater}20 classes of one-component systems, the TetR family of regulators (TFRs) are widely associated with antibiotic resistance and the regulation of genes encoding small-molecule exporters. However, TFRs play a much broader role, controlling genes involved in metabolism, antibiotic production, quorum sensing, and many other aspects of prokaryotic physiology. There are several well-established model systems for understanding these important proteins, and structural studies have begun to unveil the mechanisms by which they bind DNA and recognize small-molecule ligands. The sequences for more than 200,000 TFRs are available in the public databases, and genomics studies are identifying their target genes. Three-dimensional structures have been solved for close to 200 TFRs. Comparison of these structures reveals a common overall architecture of nine conserved α helices. The most important open question concerning TFR biology is the nature and diversity of their ligands and how these relate to the biochemical processes under their control.},

	abstract = {Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) play critical roles in biology and biotechnology, and there has been considerable interest in the engineering of DBPs with new or altered specificities for genome editing and other applications. While there has been some success in reprogramming naturally occurring DBPs using selection methods, the computational design of new DBPs that recognize arbitrary target sites remains an outstanding challenge. We describe a computational method for the design of small DBPs that recognize specific target sequences through interactions with bases in the major groove, and employ this method in conjunction with experimental screening to generate binders for 5 distinct DNA targets. These binders exhibit specificity closely matching the computational models for the target DNA sequences at as many as 6 base positions and affinities as low as 30-100 nM. The crystal structure of a designed DBP-target site complex is in close agreement with the design model, highlighting the accuracy of the design method. The designed DBPs function in both Escherichia coli and mammalian cells to repress and activate transcription of neighboring genes. Our method is a substantial step towards a general route to small and hence readily deliverable sequence-specific DBPs for gene regulation and editing.},

	abstract = {Although translational selection to favour codons that match the most abundant tRNAs is not readily observed in humans, there is nonetheless selection in humans on synonymous mutations. We hypothesize that much of this synonymous site selection can be explained in terms of protection against unwanted RNAs — spurious transcripts, mis-spliced forms or RNAs derived from transposable elements or viruses. We propose not only that selection on synonymous sites functions to reduce the rate of creation of unwanted transcripts (for example, through selection on exonic splice enhancers and cryptic splice sites) but also that high-GC content (but low-CpG content), together with intron presence and position, is both particular to functional native mRNAs and used to recognize transcripts as native. In support of this hypothesis, transcription, nuclear export, liquid phase condensation and RNA degradation have all recently been shown to promote GC-rich transcripts and suppress AU/CpG-rich ones. With such ‘traps’ being set against AU/CpG-rich transcripts, the codon usage of native genes has, in turn, evolved to avoid such suppression. That parallel filters against AU/CpG-rich transcripts also affect the endosomal import of RNAs further supports the unwanted transcript hypothesis of synonymous site selection and explains the similar design rules that have enabled the successful use of transgenes and RNA vaccines.},

Notably, the majority of tumour-specific antigens are results of noncoding translation11–13. Although the resulting polypeptides are often nonfunctional, translation of noncoding regions is nonetheless necessary for the birth of new coding sequences14,15. The mechanisms underlying the surveillance of translation in diverse noncoding regions and how escaped polypeptides evolve new functions remain unclear10,16–19. Functional polypeptides derived from annotated noncoding sequences often localize to membranes20,21. Here we integrate massively parallel analyses of more than 10,000 human genomic sequences and millions of random sequences with genome-wide CRISPR screens, accompanied by in-depth genetic and biochemical characterizations. Our results show that the intrinsic nucleotide bias in the noncoding genome and in the genetic code frequently results in polypeptides with a hydrophobic C-terminal tail, which is captured by the ribosome-associated BAG6 membrane protein triage complex for either proteasomal degradation or membrane targeting. By contrast, canonical proteins have evolved to deplete C-terminal hydrophobic residues. Our results reveal a fail-safe mechanism for the surveillance of unwanted translation from diverse noncoding regions and suggest a possible biochemical route for the preferential membrane localization of newly evolved proteins.},

Current methods for engineering orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to acylate new monomers, as required for the expansion and reprogramming of the genetic code, rely on translational readouts and therefore require the monomers to be ribosomal substrates4–6. Orthogonal synthetases cannot be evolved to acylate orthogonal tRNAs with non-canonical monomers (ncMs) that are poor ribosomal substrates, and ribosomes cannot be evolved to polymerize ncMs that cannot be acylated onto orthogonal tRNAs—this co-dependence creates an evolutionary deadlock that has essentially restricted the scope of translation in living cells to α-l-amino acids and closely related hydroxy acids. Here we break this deadlock by developing tRNA display, which enables direct, rapid and scalable selection for orthogonal synthetases that selectively acylate their cognate orthogonal tRNAs with ncMs in Escherichia coli, independent of whether the ncMs are ribosomal substrates. Using tRNA display, we directly select orthogonal synthetases that specifically acylate their cognate orthogonal tRNA with eight non-canonical amino acids and eight ncMs, including several β-amino acids, α,α-disubstituted-amino acids and β-hydroxy acids. We build on these advances to demonstrate the genetically encoded, site-specific cellular incorporation of β-amino acids and α,α-disubstituted amino acids into a protein, and thereby expand the chemical scope of the genetic code to new classes of monomers.},

We carried out deep mutational scanning (DMS) of four homologous bacterial allosteric transcription factors (aTFs) to identify hotspots and built a machine learning model with this data to glean the structural and molecular properties of allosteric hotspots. We found hotspots to be distributed protein-wide rather than being restricted to ‘pathways’ linking allosteric and active sites as is commonly assumed. Despite structural homology, the location of hotspots was not superimposable across the aTFs. However, common signatures emerged when comparing hotspots coincident with long-range interactions, suggesting that the allosteric mechanism is conserved among the homologs despite differences in molecular details. Machine learning with our large DMS datasets revealed global structural and dynamic properties to be a strong predictor of whether a residue is a hotspot than local and physicochemical properties. Furthermore, a model trained on one protein can predict hotspots in a homolog. In summary, the overall allosteric mechanism is embedded in the structural fold of the aTF family, but the finer, molecular details are sequence-specific.},

	abstract = {Dynamic control over protein function is a central challenge in synthetic biology. To address this challenge, we describe the development of an integrated computational and experimental workflow to incorporate a metal-responsive chemical switch into proteins. Pairs of bipyridinylalanine (BpyAla) residues are genetically encoded into two structurally distinct enzymes, a serine protease and firefly luciferase, so that metal coordination biases the conformations of these enzymes, leading to reversible control of activity. Computational analysis and molecular dynamics simulations are used to rationally guide BpyAla placement, significantly reducing experimental workload, and cell-free protein synthesis coupled with high-throughput experimentation enable rapid prototyping of variants. Ultimately, this strategy yields enzymes with a robust 20-fold dynamic range in response to divalent metal salts over 24 on/off switches, demonstrating the potential of this approach. We envision that this strategy of genetically encoding chemical switches into enzymes will complement other protein engineering and synthetic biology efforts, enabling new opportunities for applications where precise regulation of protein function is critical.},

	abstract = {Allostery in proteins plays an important role in regulating protein activities and influencing many biological processes such as gene expression, enzyme catalysis, and cell signaling. The process of allostery takes place when a signal detected at a site on a protein is transmitted via a mechanical pathway to a functional site and, thus, influences its activity. The pathway of allosteric communication consists of amino acids that form a network with covalent and non-covalent bonds. By mutating residues in this allosteric network, protein engineers have successfully established novel allosteric pathways to achieve desired properties in the target protein. In this review, we highlight the most recent and state-of-the-art techniques for allosteric communication engineering. We also discuss the challenges that need to be overcome and future directions for engineering protein allostery.},

The general principles of protein structure that underlie this process remain unknown. Here, we describe a sequence-based statistical method for quantitatively mapping the global network of amino acid interactions in a protein. Application of this method for three structurally and functionally distinct protein families (G protein–coupled receptors, the chymotrypsin class of serine proteases and hemoglobins) reveals a surprisingly simple architecture for amino acid interactions in each protein family: a small subset of residues forms physically connected networks that link distant functional sites in the tertiary structure. Although small in number, residues comprising the network show excellent correlation with the large body of mechanistic data available for each family. The data suggest that evolutionarily conserved sparse networks of amino acid interactions represent structural motifs for allosteric communication in proteins.},

	abstract = {The tetracycline repressor family transcriptional regulators (TFRs) are homodimeric DNA-binding proteins that generally act as transcriptional repressors. Their DNA-binding activity is allosterically inactivated by the binding of small-molecule ligands. TFRs constitute the third most frequently occurring transcriptional regulator family found in bacteria with more than 10,000 representatives in the nonredundant protein database. In addition, more than 100 unique TFR structures have been solved by X-ray crystallography. In this study, we have used computational and experimental approaches to reveal the variations and conservation present within TFRs. Although TFR structures are very diverse, we were able to identify a conserved central triangle in their ligand-binding domains that forms the foundation of the structure and the framework for the ligand-binding cavity. While the sequences of DNA-binding domains of TFRs are highly conserved across the whole family, the sequences of their ligand-binding domains are so diverse that pairwise sequence similarity is often undetectable. Nevertheless, by analyzing subfamilies of TFRs, we were able to identify distinct regions of conservation in ligand-binding domains that may be important for allostery. To aid in large-scale analyses of TFR function, we have developed a simple and reliable computational approach to predict TFR operator sequences, a temperature melt-based assay to measure DNA binding, and a generic ligand-binding assay that will likely be applicable to most TFRs. Finally, our analysis of TFR structures highlights their flexibility and provides insight into a conserved allosteric mechanism for this family.},

Previously, interpretation of circular dichroism data called for unfolding of the α-helical DNA-binding domains in absence of binding to DNA or tetracycline. Our small angle X-ray scattering of TetR(D) in solution contradicts this unfolding as a physiological process. Instead, in the core domain crystal structures analyses show increased immobilisation of helix α9 and two C-terminal turns of helix α8 upon tetracycline binding. Tetracycline complexes of TetR(D) and four single-site alanine variants were characterised by isothermal titration calorimetry, fluorescence titration, X-ray crystal structures, and melting curves. Five crystal structures confirm that Thr103 is a key residue for the allosteric events of induction, with the T103A variant lacking induction by any tetracycline. The T103A variant shows anti-cooperative inducer binding, and a melting curve of the tetracycline complex different to TetR(D) and other variants. For the N82A variant inducer binding is clearly anti-cooperative but triggers the induced conformation.},

	abstract = {Tetracycline (Tc) repressor (TetR) undergoes an allosteric transition upon interaction with the antibiotic, Tc, that abrogates its ability to specifically bind its operator DNA. In this work, by performing equilibrium protein unfolding experiments on wild-type TetR and mutants displaying altered allosteric responses, we have delineated a model to explain TetR allostery. In the absence of Tc, we show that the DNA-binding domains of this homodimeric protein are relatively flexible and unfold independently of the Tc binding/dimerization (TBD) domains. Once Tc is bound, however, the unfolding of the DNA binding domains becomes coupled to the TBD domains, leading to a large increase in DNA-binding domain stability. Noninducible TetR mutants display considerably less interdomain folding cooperativity upon binding to Tc. We conclude that the thermodynamic coupling of the TetR domains caused by Tc binding and the resulting rigidification of the DNA-binding domains into a conformation that is incompatible with DNA binding are the fundamental factors leading to the allosteric response in TetR. This allosteric mechanism can account for properties of the whole TetR family of repressors and may explain the functioning and evolution of other allosteric systems. Our model contrasts with the prevalent view that TetR populates two distinct conformations and that Tc causes a switch between these defined conformations.},

Here, we report a computational design strategy grounded in fundamental protein biophysics to guide experimental evaluation of a sparse set of mutants to identify an optimal functional window. We hypothesized that testing a limited set of mutants would direct subsequent mutagenesis efforts by predicting desirable mutant combinations from a vast mutational landscape. This strategy varies the degree of interfacial destabilization while preserving stability and catalytic activity. We validate our method by solving two distinct split protein design challenges, generating both design and mechanistic insights.

This letter shows that nuclei replicated in vitro are unable to re-replicate in fresh replication extract until they have passed through mitosis. However, the only mitotic change which is required to permit re-replication is nuclear envelope permeabiliz-ation.

In eukaryotes, this replication is initiated at hundreds to thousands of replication origins distributed over the genome, each of which must be prohibited from re-initiating DNA replication within every cell cycle. How cells prevent re-initiation has been a long-standing question in cell biology. In several eukaryotes, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) have been implicated in promoting the block to re-initiation1, but exactly how they perform this function is unclear. Here we show that B-type CDKs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae prevent re-initiation through multiple overlapping mechanisms, including phosphorylation of the origin recognition complex (ORC), downregulation of Cdc6 activity, and nuclear exclusion of the Mcm2-7 complex. Only when all three inhibitory pathways are disrupted do origins re-initiate DNA replication in G2/M cells. These studies show that each of these three independent mechanisms of regulation is functionally important.},

This claim flies in the face of current estimates according to which the fraction of the genome that is evolutionarily conserved through purifying selection is less than 10\%. Thus, according to the ENCODE Consortium, a biological function can be maintained indefinitely without selection, which implies that at least 80 − 10 = 70\% of the genome is perfectly invulnerable to deleterious mutations, either because no mutation can ever occur in these “functional” regions or because no mutation in these regions can ever be deleterious. This absurd conclusion was reached through various means, chiefly by employing the seldom used “causal role” definition of biological function and then applying it inconsistently to different biochemical properties, by committing a logical fallacy known as “affirming the consequent,” by failing to appreciate the crucial difference between “junk DNA” and “garbage DNA,” by using analytical methods that yield biased errors and inflate estimates of functionality, by favoring statistical sensitivity over specificity, and by emphasizing statistical significance rather than the magnitude of the effect. Here, we detail the many logical and methodological transgressions involved in assigning functionality to almost every nucleotide in the human genome. The ENCODE results were predicted by one of its authors to necessitate the rewriting of textbooks. We agree, many textbooks dealing with marketing, mass-media hype, and public relations may well have to be rewritten.},

Most existing models fall into one of two extremes: Either they provide a coarse-grained description that lacks biophysical realism (e.g., dN/dS models), or they require a large number of parameters to be fitted (e.g., mutation–selection models). Here, we ask whether a middle ground is possible: Can we obtain a realistic description of site-specific amino acid frequencies while severely restricting the number of free parameters in the model? We show that a distribution with a single free parameter can accurately capture the variation in amino acid frequency at most sites in an alignment, as long as we are willing to restrict our analysis to predicting amino acid frequencies by rank rather than by amino acid identity. This result holds equally well both in alignments of empirical protein sequences and of sequences evolved under a biophysically realistic all-atom force field. Our analysis reveals a near universal shape of the frequency distributions of amino acids. This insight has the potential to lead to new models of evolution that have both increased realism and a limited number of free parameters.},

Novel regulators can be mined from genomes, but an inadequate understanding of their DNA specificity complicates genetic design. Here we present Snowprint, a simple yet powerful bioinformatic tool for predicting regulator:operator interactions. Benchmarking results demonstrate that Snowprint predictions are significantly similar for {\textgreater}45\% of experimentally validated regulator:operator pairs from organisms across nine phyla and for regulators that span five distinct structural families. We then use Snowprint to design promoters for 33 previously uncharacterized regulators sourced from diverse phylogenies, of which 28 are shown to influence gene expression and 24 produce a {\textgreater}20-fold dynamic range. A panel of the newly repurposed regulators are then screened for response to biomanufacturing-relevant compounds, yielding new sensors for a polyketide (olivetolic acid), terpene (geraniol), steroid (ursodiol), and alkaloid (tetrahydropapaverine) with induction ratios up to 10.7-fold. Snowprint represents a unique, protein-agnostic tool that greatly facilitates the discovery of ligand-inducible transcriptional regulators for bioengineering applications.

Programmable control of gene expression from aTF-regulated promoter is important because different downstream effector genes function optimally at different expression levels. However, tuning gene expression of native promoters is difficult due to complex layers of homeostatic regulation encoded within them. We engineered synthetic promoters de novo by embedding operator sites with varying affinities and radically reshaped binding preferences within a minimal, constitutive Escherichia coli promoter. Multiplexed cell-based screening of promoters for three TetR-like aTFs generated with this approach gave rich diversity of gene expression levels, dynamic ranges and ligand sensitivities and were 50- to 100-fold more active over their respective native promoters. Machine learning on our dataset revealed that relative position of the core motif and bases flanking the core motif play an important role in modulating induction response. Our generalized approach yields customizable and programmable aTF-regulated promoters for engineering cellular pathways and enables the discovery of new small molecule biosensors.},

	abstract = {Targeted protein degradation is a pharmacological modality that is based on the induced proximity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a target protein to promote target ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This has been achieved either via proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs)—bifunctional compounds composed of two separate moieties that individually bind the target and E3 ligase, or via molecular glues that monovalently bind either the ligase or the target1–4. Here, using orthogonal genetic screening, biophysical characterization and structural reconstitution, we investigate the mechanism of action of bifunctional degraders of BRD2 and BRD4, termed intramolecular bivalent glues (IBGs), and find that instead of connecting target and ligase in trans as PROTACs do, they simultaneously engage and connect two adjacent domains of the target protein in cis. This conformational change ‘glues’ BRD4 to the E3 ligases DCAF11 or DCAF16, leveraging intrinsic target–ligase affinities that do not translate to BRD4 degradation in the absence of compound. Structural insights into the ternary BRD4–IBG1–DCAF16 complex guided the rational design of improved degraders of low picomolar potency. We thus introduce a new modality in targeted protein degradation, which works by bridging protein domains in cis to enhance surface complementarity with E3 ligases for productive ubiquitination and degradation.},

This methodology succeeded in generating three strains from two separate mutagenesis libraries (rpoA and rpoD) exhibiting up to a 114\% increase in L-tyrosine titer over a rationally engineered parental strain with an already high capacity for production. Subsequent strain characterization through transcriptional analysis and whole genome sequencing allowed complete phenotype reconstruction from well-defined mutations and point to important roles for both the acid stress resistance pathway and the stringent response of E. coli in imparting this phenotype. As such, this study presents one of the first examples in which cell-wide measurements have helped to elucidate the genetic and biochemical underpinnings of an engineered cellular property, leading to the total restoration of metabolite overproduction from specific chromosomal mutations.},

A multifaceted characterization of the library, especially at the single-cell level to ensure homogeneity, permitted quantitative assessment correlating the effect of gene expression levels to improved growth and product formation phenotypes in Escherichia coli. Integration of these promoters into the chromosome can allow for a quantitative accurate assessment of genetic control. To this end, we used the characterized library of promoters to assess the impact of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase levels on growth yield and deoxy-xylulose-P synthase levels on lycopene production. The multifaceted characterization of promoter strength enabled identification of optimal expression levels for ppc and dxs, which maximized the desired phenotype. Additionally, in a strain preengineered to produce lycopene, the response to deoxy-xylulose-P synthase levels was linear at all levels tested, indicative of a rate-limiting step, unlike the parental strain, which exhibited an optimum expression level, illustrating that optimal gene expression levels are variable and dependent on the genetic background of the strain. This promoter library concept is illustrated as being generalizable to eukaryotic organisms (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and thus constitutes an integral platform for functional genomics, synthetic biology, and metabolic engineering endeavors.},

One type of GCE, sense codon reassignment (SCR), focuses on breaking the degeneracy of the 61 sense codons which encode for only 20 amino acids. SCR has great potential for genetic code expansion, but extensive SCR is limited by the post-transcriptional modifications on tRNAs and wobble reading of these tRNAs by the ribosome. To better understand codon-tRNA pairing, here we develop an assay to evaluate the ability of aminoacyl-tRNAs to compete with each other for a given codon. We then show that hyperaccurate ribosome mutants demonstrate reduced wobble reading, and when paired with unmodified tRNAs lead to extensive and predictable SCR. Together, we encode seven distinct amino acids across nine codons spanning just two codon boxes, thereby demonstrating that the genetic code hosts far more re-assignable space than previously expected, opening the door to extensive genetic code engineering.},

In pooled CRISPR screens, various genetically encoded perturbations are introduced into pools of cells. The targeted cells proliferate under a biological challenge such as cell competition, drug treatment or viral infection. Subsequently, the perturbation-induced effects are evaluated by sequencing-based counting of the guide RNAs that specify each perturbation. The typical results of such screens are ranked lists of genes that confer sensitivity or resistance to the biological challenge of interest. Contributing to the broad utility of CRISPR screens, adaptations of the core CRISPR technology make it possible to activate, silence or otherwise manipulate the target genes. Moreover, high-content read-outs such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial imaging help characterize screened cells with unprecedented detail. Dedicated software tools facilitate bioinformatic analysis and enhance reproducibility. CRISPR screening has unravelled various molecular mechanisms in basic biology, medical genetics, cancer research, immunology, infectious diseases, microbiology and other fields.

The method relies on tRNA-codon coadaptation of coding sequences in the K. phaffii genome and is based on two complementary scores: the number of effective codons and the tRNA adaptation index. Genes with high codon bias are expected to be translated efficiently and, thus, also be under control of strong promoters. Using this approach, we identified promising strong promoter candidates and experimentally assessed their activity using fluorescent reporter assays characterizing 50 promoters spanning a 76-fold difference in expression levels in a glucose medium.

The TetR protein and its mutants are commonly used as control elements to regulate gene expression in higher eukaryotes. We present the crystal structure of the TetR homodimer in complex with its palindromic DNA operator at 2.5 Å resolution. Comparison to the structure of TetR in complex with the inducer tetracycline-Mg2+ allows the mechanism of induction to be deduced. Inducer binding in the repressor core initiates conformational changes starting with C-terminal unwinding and shifting of the short helix α6 in each monomer. This forces a pendulum-like motion of helix α4, which increases the separation of the attached DNA binding domains by 3 Å, abolishing the affinity of TetR for its operator DNA.},

	abstract = {The development of synthetic biological systems requires modular biomolecular components to flexibly alter response pathways. In previous studies, we have established a module-swapping design principle to engineer allosteric response and DNA recognition properties among regulators in the LacI family, in which the engineered regulators served as effective components for implementing new cellular behavior. Here we introduced this protein engineering strategy to two regulators in the TetR family: TetR (UniProt Accession ID: P04483) and MphR (Q9EVJ6). The TetR DNA-binding module and the MphR ligand-binding module were used to create the TetR-MphR. This resulting hybrid regulator possesses DNA-binding properties of TetR and ligand response properties of MphR, which is able to control gene expression in response to a molecular signal in cells. Furthermore, we studied molecular interactions between the TetR DNA-binding module and MphR ligand-binding module by using mutant analysis. Together, we demonstrated that TetR family regulators contain discrete and functional modules that can be used to build biological components with novel properties. This work highlights the utility of rational design as a means of creating modular parts for cell engineering and introduces new possibilities in rewiring cellular response pathways.},

Nevertheless, various barriers restrict the efficacy and/or prevent the widespread use of CAR T cell therapies in these patients as well as in those with other cancers, particularly solid tumours. Key challenges relating to CAR T cells include severe toxicities, restricted trafficking to, infiltration into and activation within tumours, suboptimal persistence in vivo, antigen escape and heterogeneity, and manufacturing issues. The evolution of CAR designs beyond the conventional structures will be necessary to address these limitations and to expand the use of CAR T cells to a wider range of malignancies. Investigators are addressing the current obstacles with a wide range of engineering strategies in order to improve the safety, efficacy and applicability of this therapeutic modality. In this Review, we discuss the innovative designs of novel CAR T cell products that are being developed to increase and expand the clinical benefits of these treatments in patients with diverse cancers.},

Hence, few observations ({\textasciitilde}100 times the number of mutated residues) enable accurate prediction of held-out variant effects (Pearson r {\textgreater} 0.80). We hypothesized that the local structural contexts around a residue could be sufficient to predict mutation preferences, and develop an unsupervised approach termed CoVES (Combinatorial Variant Effects from Structure). Our results suggest that CoVES outperforms not just model-free methods but also similarly to complex models for creating functional and diverse protein variants.

Hypoxia has a profound effect on the biological behavior and malignant phenotype of cancer cells, mediates the effects of cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy through complex mechanisms, and is closely associated with poor prognosis in various cancer patients. Accumulating studies have demonstrated that through normalization of the tumor vasculature, nanoparticle carriers and biocarriers can effectively increase the oxygen concentration in the tumor microenvironment, improve drug delivery and the efficacy of radiotherapy. They also increase infiltration of innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune cells to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. Furthermore, drugs targeting key genes associated with hypoxia, including hypoxia tracers, hypoxia-activated prodrugs, and drugs targeting hypoxia-inducible factors and downstream targets, can be used for visualization and quantitative analysis of tumor hypoxia and antitumor activity. However, the relationship between hypoxia and cancer is an area of research that requires further exploration. Here, we investigated the potential factors in the development of hypoxia in cancer, changes in signaling pathways that occur in cancer cells to adapt to hypoxic environments, the mechanisms of hypoxia-induced cancer immune tolerance, chemotherapeutic tolerance, and enhanced radiation tolerance, as well as the insights and applications of hypoxia in cancer therapy.},

	abstract = {Gene regulation is essential for life and controlled by regulatory DNA. Mutations can modify the activity of regulatory DNA, and also create new regulatory DNA, a process called regulatory emergence. Non-regulatory and regulatory DNA contain motifs to which transcription factors may bind. Prokaryotic gene expression requires a stretch of regulatory DNA called a promoter, which contains two promoter motifs called -10 and -35 boxes. However, these motifs may occur in both promoters and non-regulatory DNA in multiple copies. It is possible that these motifs influence both the evolution and emergence of regulatory DNA, but this has never been thoroughly tested. To understand whether and how promoter motifs influence promoter emergence and evolution, we start from 25 DNA sequences enriched with -10 and -35 box motifs (promoter islands), mutagenize the sequences, and measure gene expression driven by 240,000 mutants. We find that the probability that mutations create an active promoter varies more than 200-fold, but is not correlated with the number of promoter motifs. In most mutants ({\textasciitilde}67\%), the weakening, strengthening, or emergence of a promoter is caused by mutations that modify already existing motifs. Notably, creating new motifs can either increase or decrease promoter activity. Our work demonstrates how promoter motifs influence promoter emergence and evolution. It has implications for predicting and understanding regulatory evolution, de-novo genes, and phenotypic evolution.},

CAR-T cells expanded to a much lower extent in 1\% oxygen than in 18\% oxygen. Hypoxic CAR-T cells also had a less differentiated phenotype and a higher CD4:CD8 ratio than atmospheric CAR-T cells. CAR-T cells were then added to antigen-positive and antigen-negative tumor cell lines at the same or lower oxygen level and characterized for cytotoxicity, cytokine and granzyme B secretion, and PD-1 upregulation. Atmospheric and hypoxic CAR-T cells exhibited comparable cytolytic activity and PD-1 upregulation; however, cytokine production and granzyme B release were greatly decreased in 1\% oxygen, even when the CAR-T cells were generated in atmospheric culture. Together, these data show that at solid tumor oxygen levels, CAR-T cells are impaired in expansion, differentiation and cytokine production. These effects may contribute to the inability of CAR-T cells to eradicate solid tumors seen in many patients.},

This study presents a stringent hypoxia-sensing CAR T cell system that achieves selective expression of a pan-ErbB-targeted CAR within a solid tumor, a microenvironment characterized by inadequate oxygen supply. Using murine xenograft models, we demonstrate that, despite widespread expression of ErbB receptors in healthy organs, the approach provides anti-tumor efficacy without off-tumor toxicity.

	abstract = {Organofluorine compounds are known to be toxic to a broad variety of living beings in different habitats, and chemical fluorination has been historically exploited by mankind for the development of therapeutic drugs or agricultural pesticides. On the other hand, several studies so far have demonstrated that, under appropriate conditions, living systems (in particular bacteria) can tolerate the presence of fluorinated molecules (e.g., amino acids analogues) within their metabolism and even repurpose them as alternative building blocks for the synthesis of cellular macromolecules such as proteins. Understanding the molecular mechanism behind these phenomena would greatly advance approaches to the biotechnological synthesis of recombinant proteins and peptide drugs. However, information about the metabolic effects of long-term exposure of living cells to fluorinated amino acids remains scarce. Hereby, we report the long-term propagation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in an artificially fluorinated habitat that yielded two strains naturally adapted to live on fluorinated amino acids. In particular, we applied selective pressure to force a tryptophan (Trp)-auxotrophic strain to use either 4- or 5-fluoroindole as essential precursors for the in situ synthesis of Trp analogues, followed by their incorporation in the cellular proteome. We found that full adaptation to both fluorinated Trp analogues requires a low number of genetic mutations but is accompanied by large rearrangements in regulatory networks, membrane integrity, and quality control of protein folding. These findings highlight the cellular mechanisms behind the adaptation to unnatural amino acids and provide the molecular foundation for bioengineering of novel microbial strains for synthetic biology and biotechnology.},

	abstract = {The helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain is a common denominator in basal and specific transcription factors from the three super-kingdoms of life. At its core, the domain comprises of an open tri-helical bundle, which typically binds DNA with the 3rd helix. Drawing on the wealth of data that has accumulated over two decades since the discovery of the domain, we present an overview of the natural history of the HTH domain from the viewpoint of structural analysis and comparative genomics. In structural terms, the HTH domains have developed several elaborations on the basic 3-helical core, such as the tetra-helical bundle, the winged-helix and the ribbon-helix–helix type configurations. In functional terms, the HTH domains are present in the most prevalent transcription factors of all prokaryotic genomes and some eukaryotic genomes. They have been recruited to a wide range of functions beyond transcription regulation, which include DNA repair and replication, RNA metabolism and protein–protein interactions in diverse signaling contexts. Beyond their basic role in mediating macromolecular interactions, the HTH domains have also been incorporated into the catalytic domains of diverse enzymes. We discuss the general domain architectural themes that have arisen amongst the HTH domains as a result of their recruitment to these diverse functions. We present a natural classification, higher-order relationships and phyletic pattern analysis of all the major families of HTH domains. This reconstruction suggests that there were at least 6–11 different HTH domains in the last universal common ancestor of all life forms, which covered much of the structural diversity and part of the functional versatility of the extant representatives of this domain. In prokaryotes the total number of HTH domains per genome shows a strong power-equation type scaling with the gene number per genome. However, the HTH domains in two-component signaling pathways show a linear scaling with gene number, in contrast to the non-linear scaling of HTH domains in single-component systems and sigma factors. These observations point to distinct evolutionary forces in the emergence of different signaling systems with HTH transcription factors. The archaea and bacteria share a number of ancient families of specific HTH transcription factors. However, they do not share any orthologous HTH proteins in the basal transcription apparatus. This differential relationship of their basal and specific transcriptional machinery poses an apparent conundrum regarding the origins of their transcription apparatus.},

As a consequence, the forces shaping its early evolution have been difficult to reconstruct. Herein, we analyze this large and diverse family with a combination of traditional phylogenetic techniques and newer sequence analysis tools to determine whether the helix–turn–helix family arose from a single common ancestor. Our analyses of the DNA-binding domain show that amino acid chemistry is conserved at many sites in the first helix and the turn. The high level of divergence combined with the short length of the domain hinders robust reconstruction of the entire phylogeny, but some level of deep node inference is possible. All analyses point to a predominantly monophyletic origin for the helix–turn–helix domain. The consequences of such an origin for a diverse group of proteins, and guidelines for the identification of future members of the HTH family are discussed.},

In addition, they regulate and effect various cellular processes like transcription, DNA replication, DNA recombination, repair and modification. The experimental methods used to identify DNA-binding proteins are expensive and time consuming and thus attracted researchers from computational field to address the problem. In this paper, we present iDNAProt-ES, a DNA-binding protein prediction method that utilizes both sequence based evolutionary and structure based features of proteins to identify their DNA-binding functionality. We used recursive feature elimination to extract an optimal set of features and train them using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel to select the final model. Our proposed method significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art predictors on standard benchmark dataset. The accuracy of the predictor is 90.18\% using jack knife test and 88.87\% using 10-fold cross validation on the benchmark dataset. The accuracy of the predictor on the independent dataset is 80.64\% which is also significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods. iDNAProt-ES is a novel prediction method that uses evolutionary and structural based features. We believe the superior performance of iDNAProt-ES will motivate the researchers to use this method to identify DNA-binding proteins. iDNAProt-ES is publicly available as a web server at: http://brl.uiu.ac.bd/iDNAProt-ES/.},

	abstract = {DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors use DNA-binding domains (DBDs) to bind to specific sequences in the genome to initiate many important biological functions. Accurate prediction of such target sequences, often represented by position weight matrices (PWMs), is an important step to understand many biological processes. Recent studies have shown that knowledge-based potential functions can be applied on protein-DNA co-crystallized structures to generate PWMs that are considerably consistent with experimental data. However, this success has not been extended to DNA-binding proteins lacking co-crystallized structures. This study aims at investigating the possibility of predicting the DNA sequences bound by DNA-binding proteins from the proteins' unbound structures (structures of the unbound state). Given an unbound query protein and a template complex, the proposed method first employs structure alignment to generate synthetic protein-DNA complexes for the query protein. Once a complex is available, an atomic-level knowledge-based potential function is employed to predict PWMs characterizing the sequences to which the query protein can bind. The evaluation of the proposed method is based on seven DNA-binding proteins, which have structures of both DNA-bound and unbound forms for prediction as well as annotated PWMs for validation. Since this work is the first attempt to predict target sequences of DNA-binding proteins from their unbound structures, three types of structural variations that presumably influence the prediction accuracy were examined and discussed. Based on the analyses conducted in this study, the conformational change of proteins upon binding DNA was shown to be the key factor. This study sheds light on the challenge of predicting the target DNA sequences of a protein lacking co-crystallized structures, which encourages more efforts on the structure alignment-based approaches in addition to docking- and homology modeling-based approaches for generating synthetic complexes.},

	abstract = {The genetic code—the binding specificity of all transfer-RNAs—defines how protein primary structure is determined by DNA sequence. DNA also dictates when and where proteins are expressed, and this information is encoded in a pattern of specific sequence motifs that are recognized by transcription factors. However, the DNA-binding specificity is only known for a small fraction of the ∼1400 human transcription factors (TFs). We describe here a high-throughput method for analyzing transcription factor binding specificity that is based on systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and massively parallel sequencing. The method is optimized for analysis of large numbers of TFs in parallel through the use of affinity-tagged proteins, barcoded selection oligonucleotides, and multiplexed sequencing. Data are analyzed by a new bioinformatic platform that uses the hundreds of thousands of sequencing reads obtained to control the quality of the experiments and to generate binding motifs for the TFs. The described technology allows higher throughput and identification of much longer binding profiles than current microarray-based methods. In addition, as our method is based on proteins expressed in mammalian cells, it can also be used to characterize DNA-binding preferences of full-length proteins or proteins requiring post-translational modifications. We validate the method by determining binding specificities of 14 different classes of TFs and by confirming the specificities for NFATC1 and RFX3 using ChIP-seq. Our results reveal unexpected dimeric modes of binding for several factors that were thought to preferentially bind DNA as monomers.},

This review considers how TFs are identified and functionally characterized, principally through the lens of a catalog of over 1,600 likely human TFs and binding motifs for two-thirds of them. Major classes of human TFs differ markedly in their evolutionary trajectories and expression patterns, underscoring distinct functions.

ZFDesign is a modern machine learning method that models global and target-specific differences induced by a range of library environments and specifically takes into account compatibility of neighboring fingers using a novel hierarchical transformer architecture. We demonstrate the versatility of designed ZFs as nucleases as well as activators and repressors by seamless reprogramming of human transcription factors. These factors could be used to upregulate an allele of haploinsufficiency, downregulate a gain-of-function mutation or test the consequence of regulation of a single gene as opposed to the many genes that a transcription factor would normally influence.},

Furthermore, small clusters with binding sites an order of magnitude lower in affinity give rise to high mean occupancies at physiologically-relevant transcription factor concentrations. To assess whether the observed in vitro occupancies translate to transcriptional activation in vivo, we tested low-affinity binding site clusters in a synthetic and native gene regulatory network in S. cerevisiae. In both systems, clusters of low-affinity binding sites generated transcriptional output comparable to single or even multiple consensus sites. This systematic characterization demonstrates that clusters of low-affinity binding sites achieve substantial occupancies, and that this occupancy can drive expression in eukaryotic promoters.},

Recently, it has emerged that there are many TFTRs which act as global multi-target regulators. Our classical view of TFTRs as simple, single-target regulators therefore needs to be reconsidered. As some TFTRs regulate essential processes (e.g. metabolism) or processes which are important determinants of resistance and virulence (e.g. biofilm formation and efflux gene expression) and as TFTRs are present throughout pathogenic bacteria, they may be good drug discovery targets for tackling antimicrobial resistant infections. However, the prevalence and conservation of individual TFTR genes in Gram-negative species, has to our knowledge, not yet been studied.},

Our study covers the majority of the soluble E. coli proteome expressed during log-phase growth, and among this group, we find that one-third of the E. coli proteome is not intrinsically refoldable on physiological time scales, a cohort that is enriched with certain fold-types, domain organizations, and other biophysical features. We also identify several properties and fold-types that are correlated with slow refolding on the minute time scale.

	abstract = {DNA-binding proteins play an important role in gene regulation and cellular function. The transcription factors MarA and Rob are two homologous members of the AraC/XylS family that regulate multidrug resistance. They share a common DNA-binding domain, and Rob possesses an additional C-terminal domain that permits binding of low-molecular weight effectors. Both proteins possess two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs capable of binding DNA; however, while MarA interacts with its promoter through both HTH-motifs, prior studies indicate that Rob binding to DNA via a single HTH-motif is sufficient for tight binding. In the present work, we perform microsecond time scale all-atom simulations of the binding of both transcription factors to different DNA sequences to understand the determinants of DNA recognition and binding. Our simulations characterize sequence-dependent changes in dynamical behavior upon DNA binding, showcasing the role of Arg40 of the N-terminal HTH-motif in allowing for specific tight binding. Finally, our simulations demonstrate that an acidic C-terminal loop of Rob can control the DNA binding mode, facilitating interconversion between the distinct DNA binding modes observed in MarA and Rob. In doing so, we provide detailed molecular insight into DNA binding and recognition by these proteins, which in turn is an important step toward the efficient design of antivirulence agents that target these proteins.},

The forkhead family of TFs, defined by a highly conserved winged helix DNA-binding domain (DBD), has diverged into dozens of subfamilies in animals, fungi, and related protists. We have used a combination of maximum-likelihood phylogenetic inference and independent, comprehensive functional assays of DNA-binding capacity to explore the evolution of DNA-binding specificity within the forkhead family. We present converging evidence that similar alternative sequence preferences have arisen repeatedly and independently in the course of forkhead evolution. The vast majority of DNA-binding specificity changes we observed are not explained by alterations in the known DNA-contacting amino acid residues conferring specificity for canonical forkhead binding sites. Intriguingly, we have found forkhead DBDs that retain the ability to bind very specifically to two completely distinct DNA sequence motifs. We propose an alternate specificity-determining mechanism whereby conformational rearrangements of the DBD broaden the spectrum of sequence motifs that a TF can recognize. DNA-binding bispecificity suggests a previously undescribed source of modularity and flexibility in gene regulation and may play an important role in the evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks.},

	abstract = {Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that interact with response elements within regulated genes. Most receptors, typified by the estrogen receptor, have three amino acids within the DNA-binding domain that specify recognition of the sequence TGACCT within the response element. However, in the glucocorticoid group of receptors, these residues have evolved to recognize the sequence TGTTCT. Saturation mutagenesis was used to investigate the role played by two of these residues (Gly-439 and Ser-440 of the human glucocorticoid receptor) in receptor specificity. We conclude that these residues, and their equivalents in the estrogen receptor, play roles unique to the respective amino acids. In the glucocorticoid receptor the side chain hydroxyl group is the important component of Ser-440 that contributes to specificity by inhibiting interaction with estrogen response elements. Several substitution mutants at position 439 interact well with estrogen response elements; therefore, the unique specificity feature of Glu-439, which mimics the estrogen receptor, is its inhibition of interaction with noncognate sites. In contrast to position 440, where most substitutions prevent interaction with DNA, replacements of residue 439 have the potential to contribute to the evolution of DNA-binding specificities within the nuclear receptor family. The liver-enriched HNF-4 and Drosophila Tailless transcription factors are known examples of receptors that have diverged at this position.},

	abstract = {The genomic era has revealed that the large repertoire of observed animal phenotypes is dependent on changes in the expression patterns of a finite number of genes, which are mediated by a plethora of transcription factors (TFs) with distinct specificities. The dimerization of TFs can also increase the complexity of a genetic regulatory network manifold, by combining a small number of monomers into dimers with distinct functions. Therefore, studying the evolution of these dimerizing TFs is vital for understanding how complexity increased during animal evolution. We focus on the second largest family of dimerizing TFs, the basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP), and infer when it expanded and how bZIP DNA-binding and dimerization functions evolved during the major phases of animal evolution. Specifically, we classify the metazoan bZIPs into 19 families and confirm the ancient nature of at least 13 of these families, predating the split of the cnidaria. We observe fixation of a core dimerization network in the last common ancestor of protostomes–deuterostomes. This was followed by an expansion of the number of proteins in the network, but no major dimerization changes in interaction partners, during the emergence of vertebrates. In conclusion, the bZIPs are an excellent model with which to understand how DNA binding and protein interactions of TFs evolved during animal evolution.},

Here we use the comparative genomics approach to reconstruct regulons and identify binding motifs of regulators from three subfamilies of the GntR family, FadR, HutC, and YtrA. Using these data, we attempt to predict DNA-protein contacts by analyzing correlations between binding motifs in DNA and amino acid sequences of TFs. We identify pairs of positions with high correlation between amino acids and nucleotides for FadR, HutC, and YtrA subfamilies and show that the most predicted DNA-protein interactions are quite similar in all subfamilies and conform well to the experimentally identified contacts formed by FadR from E. coli and AraR from B. subtilis. The most frequent predicted contacts in the analyzed subfamilies are Arg-G, Asn-A, Asp-C. We also analyze the divergon structure and preferred site positions relative to regulated genes in the FadR and HutC subfamilies. A single site in a divergon usually regulates both operons and is approximately in the middle of the intergenic area. Double sites are either involved in the co-operative regulation of both operons and then are in the center of the intergenic area, or each site in the pair independently regulates its own operon and tends to be near it. We also identify additional candidate TF-binding boxes near palindromic binding sites of TFs from the FadR, HutC, and YtrA subfamilies, which may play role in the binding of additional TF-subunits.},

In order to gain insight into the evolution of the E.coli regulatory network, we analysed information obtainable for the domains and protein families of the transcription factors and regulated genes. About three‐quarters of the 271 transcription factors we identified are two‐domain proteins, consisting of a DNA‐binding domain along with a regulatory domain. The regulatory domains mainly bind small molecules. Many groups of transcription factors have identical domain architectures, and this implies that roughly three‐quarters of the transcription factors have arisen as a consequence of gene duplication. In contrast, there is little evidence of duplication of regulatory regions together with regulated genes or of transcription factors together with regulated genes. Thirty‐eight, out of the 121 transcription factors for which one or more regulated genes are known, regulate other transcription factors. This amplification effect, as well as large differences between the numbers of genes directly regulated by transcription factors, means that there are about 10 global regulators which each control many more genes than the other transcription factors.},

Allosteric transcription factors (aTF), which are widely used as biosensors, have proven challenging to design because mutating ligand-binding residues often disrupt allostery. Moreover, existing screening methods lack the sensitivity to identify rare, functional variants amidst a large pool of non-functional designs. We introduce Sensor-seq, a platform for designing and screening aTF biosensors with non-native ligand specificity. Sensor-seq uses phylogeny-guided library design, implicitly capturing allostery, and employs an RNA barcoding system for sensitive, highly multiplexed screening. From a library of 17,737 variants of aTF TtgR, Sensor-seq identified novel biosensors for six non-native ligands with high dynamic range and diverse specificity profiles. The structure of a naltrexone-bound design showed shape complementary methionine-aromatic interactions driving ligand specificity. To demonstrate practical utility, we developed cell-free detection systems with our designed biosensors. Sensor-seq enables rapid, scalable design of new biosensors, overcoming constraints of natural biosensors.},

One major mechanism that underlies antibiotic resistance in bacteria is the active extrusion of toxic compounds through the membrane-bound efflux pumps that are often regulated at the transcriptional level. TtgR represses the transcription of TtgABC, a key efflux pump in Pseudomonas putida, which is highly resistant to antibiotics, solvents and toxic plant secondary products. Previously we showed that TtgR is the only reported repressor that binds to different classes of natural antimicrobial compounds, which are also extruded by the efflux pump. We report here five high-resolution crystal structures of TtgR from the solvent-tolerant strain DOT-T1E, including TtgR in complex with common antibiotics and plant secondary metabolites. We provide structural basis for the unique ligand binding properties of TtgR. We identify two distinct and overlapping ligand binding sites; the first one is broader and consists of mainly hydrophobic residues, whereas the second one is deeper and contains more polar residues including Arg176, a unique residue present in the DOT-T1E strain but not in other Pseudomonas strains. Phloretin, a plant antimicrobial, can bind to both binding sites with distinct binding affinities and stoichiometries. Results on ligand binding properties of native and mutant TtgR proteins using isothermal titration calorimetry confirm the binding affinities and stoichiometries, and suggest a potential positive cooperativity between the two binding sites. The importance of Arg176 in phloretin binding was further confirmed by the reduced ability of phloretin in releasing the mutant TtgR from bound DNA compared to the native protein. The results presented here highlight the importance and versatility of regulatory systems in bacterial antibiotic resistance and open up new avenues for novel antimicrobial development.},

We show that activation of each sensor is orthogonal to the other sensors, and to other common inducible systems. We demonstrate independent control of three fluorescent proteins in a single cell, chemically defining eight unique transcriptional states. To demonstrate biosensor utility in metabolic engineering, we apply the glucarate biosensor to monitor product formation in a heterologous glucarate biosynthesis pathway and identify superior enzyme variants. Doubling the number of well-characterized inducible systems makes more complex synthetic biological circuits accessible. Characterizing sensors that transduce the intracellular concentration of valuable metabolites into fluorescent readouts enables high-throughput screening of biological catalysts and alleviates the primary bottleneck of the metabolic engineering design-build-test cycle.},

However, functional differences between natively occurring ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operon sequences remain poorly characterized. Here, we use an in vitro ribosome synthesis and translation platform to measure protein production capabilities of ribosomes derived from all unique combinations of 16S and 23S rRNAs from seven distinct Escherichia coli rRNA operon sequences. We observe that polymorphisms that distinguish native E. coli rRNA operons lead to significant functional changes in the resulting ribosomes, ranging from negligible or low gene expression to matching the protein production activity of the standard rRNA operon B sequence. We go on to generate strains expressing single rRNA operons and show that not only do some purified in vivo expressed homogeneous ribosome pools outperform the wild-type, heterogeneous ribosome pool but also that a crude cell lysate made from the strain expressing only operon A ribosomes shows significant yield increases for a panel of medically and industrially relevant proteins. We anticipate that ribosome pool engineering can be applied as a tool to increase yields across many protein biomanufacturing systems, as well as improve basic understanding of ribosome heterogeneity and evolution.},

	abstract = {The need for drugs with fewer side effects cannot be overemphasized. Today, most drugs modify the actions of enzymes, receptors, transporters and other molecules by directly binding to their active (orthosteric) sites. However, orthosteric site configuration is similar in several proteins performing related functions and this leads to a lower specificity of a drug for the desired protein. Consequently, such drugs may have adverse side effects. A new basis of drug discovery is emerging based on the binding of the drug molecules to sites away (allosteric) from the orthosteric sites. It is possible to find allosteric sites which are unique and hence more specific as targets for drug discovery. Of many available examples, two are highlighted here. The first is caloxins - a new class of highly specific inhibitors of plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps. The second concerns the modulation of receptors for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which binds to 12 types of receptors. Exploitation of allosteric sites has led to the discovery of drugs which can selectively modulate the activation of only 1 (M1 muscarinic) out of the 12 different types of acetylcholine receptors. These drugs are being tested for schizophrenia treatment. It is anticipated that the drug discovery exploiting allosteric sites will lead to more effective therapeutic agents with fewer side effects.},

The list of proteins under allosteric regulation includes AGC protein kinases. AGC kinases have a conserved allosteric site, the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)-interacting fragment (PIF) pocket, which regulates protein ATP-binding, activity, and interaction with substrates. In this study, we identify small molecules that bind to the ATP-binding site and affect the PIF pocket of AGC kinase family members, PDK1 and Aurora kinase. We describe the mechanistic details and show that although PDK1 and Aurora kinase inhibitors bind to the conserved ATP-binding site, they differentially modulate physiological interactions at the PIF-pocket site.

We describe the evolution of the allostery concept, from a conformational change in a two-state model (1965, 1966) to dynamic allostery in the ensemble model (1999); from multi-subunit (1965) proteins to all proteins (2004). We highlight the current available methods to study allostery and their applications in studies of conformational mechanisms, disease, and allosteric drug discovery.

The scCro-tag successfully bound a transglutaminase 2 (TGase 2) substrate and manganese peroxidase (MnP) to microbeads via scaffolding DNA. The resulting protein-coated microbeads can be utilized for functional analysis of the enzymatic activity using flow cytometry. The quantity of bead-bound proteins can be enhanced by increasing the number of ORCs.

	abstract = {Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ (ONT) long read sequencers offer access to longer DNA fragments than previous sequencer generations, at the cost of a higher error rate. While many papers have studied read correction methods, few have addressed the detailed characterization of observed errors, a task complicated by frequent changes in chemistry and software in ONT technology. The MinION sequencer is now more stable and this paper proposes an up-to-date view of its error landscape, using the most mature flowcell and basecaller. We studied Nanopore sequencing error biases on both bacterial and human DNA reads. We found that, although Nanopore sequencing is expected not to suffer from GC bias, it is a crucial parameter with respect to errors. In particular, low-GC reads have fewer errors than high-GC reads (about 6\% and 8\% respectively). The error profile for homopolymeric regions or regions with short repeats, the source of about half of all sequencing errors, also depends on the GC rate and mainly shows deletions, although there are some reads with long insertions. Another interesting finding is that the quality measure, although over-estimated, offers valuable information to predict the error rate as well as the abundance of reads. We supplemented this study with an analysis of a rapeseed RNA read set and shown a higher level of errors with a higher level of deletion in these data. Finally, we have implemented an open source pipeline for long-term monitoring of the error profile, which enables users to easily compute various analysis presented in this work, including for future developments of the sequencing device. Overall, we hope this work will provide a basis for the design of better error-correction methods.},

With longer reads, we can sequence through extended repetitive regions and detect mutations, many of which are associated with diseases. Moreover, PacBio transcriptome sequencing is advantageous for the identification of gene isoforms and facilitates reliable discoveries of novel genes and novel isoforms of annotated genes, due to its ability to sequence full-length transcripts or fragments with significant lengths. Additionally, PacBio’s sequencing technique provides information that is useful for the direct detection of base modifications, such as methylation. In addition to using PacBio sequencing alone, many hybrid sequencing strategies have been developed to make use of more accurate short reads in conjunction with PacBio long reads. In general, hybrid sequencing strategies are more affordable and scalable especially for small-size laboratories than using PacBio Sequencing alone. The advent of PacBio sequencing has made available much information that could not be obtained via SGS alone.},

	abstract = {Understanding the basis of the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs) has been of long-standing interest. Despite extensive efforts to map millions of putative TF binding sequences, identifying the critical determinants for DNA binding specificity remains a major challenge. The coevolution of residues in proteins occurs due to a shared evolutionary history. However, it is unclear how coevolving residues in TFs contribute to DNA binding specificity. Here, we systematically collected publicly available data sets from multiple large-scale high-throughput TF–DNA interaction screening experiments for the major TF families with large numbers of TF members. These families included the Homeobox, HLH, bZIP\_1, Ets, HMG\_box, ZF-C4, and Zn\_clus TFs. We detected TF subclass-determining sites (TSDSs) and showed that the TSDSs were more likely to coevolve with other TSDSs than with non-TSDSs, particularly for the Homeobox, HLH, Ets, bZIP\_1, and HMG\_box TF families. By in silico modeling, we showed that mutation of the highly coevolving residues could significantly reduce the stability of the TF–DNA complex. The distant residues from the DNA interface also contributed to TF–DNA binding activity. Overall, our study gave evidence that coevolved residues relate to transcriptional regulation and provided insights into the potential application of engineered DNA-binding domains and proteins.
IMPORTANCE While unraveling DNA-binding specificity of TFs is the key to understanding the basis and molecular mechanism of gene expression regulation, identifying the critical determinants that contribute to DNA binding specificity remains a major challenge. In this study, we provided evidence showing that coevolving residues in TF domains contributed to DNA binding specificity. We demonstrated that the TSDSs were more likely to coevolve with other TSDSs than with non-TSDSs. Mutation of the coevolving residue pairs (CRPs) could significantly reduce the stability of THE TF–DNA complex, and even the distant residues from the DNA interface contribute to TF–DNA binding activity. Collectively, our study expands our knowledge of the interactions among coevolved residues in TFs, tertiary contacting, and functional importance in refined transcriptional regulation. Understanding the impact of coevolving residues in TFs will help understand the details of transcription of gene regulation and advance the application of engineered DNA-binding domains and protein.},

In many of those applications, sequencing errors need to be corrected. This is particularly important when sequencing reads from an unknown reference such as random DNA barcodes. In this case, error correction can be done by performing a pairwise comparison of all the barcodes, which is a computationally complex problem.Results: Here, we address this challenge and describe an exact algorithm to determine which pairs of sequences lie within a given Levenshtein distance. For error correction or redundancy reduction purposes, matched pairs are then merged into clusters of similar sequences. The efficiency of starcode is attributable to the poucet search, a novel implementation of the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm performed on the nodes of a trie. On the task of matching random barcodes, starcode outperforms sequence clustering algorithms in both speed and precision.Availability and implementation: The C source code is available at http://github.com/gui11aume/starcode.Contact:  guillaume.filion@gmail.com},

Because of its advantages, applications for bar-seq are quickly growing—from using neutral random barcodes to study the evolution of microbes or cancer, to using pseudo-barcodes, such as shRNAs or sgRNAs to simultaneously screen large numbers of cell perturbations. However, the computational pipelines for bar-seq clustering are not well developed. Available methods often yield a high frequency of under-clustering artifacts that result in spurious barcodes, or over-clustering artifacts that group distinct barcodes together. Here, we developed Bartender, an accurate clustering algorithm to detect barcodes and their abundances from raw next-generation sequencing data.In contrast with existing methods that cluster based on sequence similarity alone, Bartender uses a modified two-sample proportion test that also considers cluster size. This modification results in higher accuracy and lower rates of under- and over-clustering artifacts. Additionally, Bartender includes unique molecular identifier handling and a ‘multiple time point’ mode that matches barcode clusters between different clustering runs for seamless handling of time course data. Bartender is a set of simple-to-use command line tools that can be performed on a laptop at comparable run times to existing methods.Bartender is available at no charge for non-commercial use at https://github.com/LaoZZZZZ/bartender-1.1.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Lineage tracking is widely applied, e.g. to understand evolutionary dynamics in microbial populations and the progression of breast cancer in humans. Barcode sequences are unknown upon insertion and must be identified using next-generation sequencing technology, which is error prone. In this study, we frame the barcode error correction task as a clustering problem with the aim to identify true barcode sequences from noisy sequencing data. We present Shepherd, a novel clustering method that is based on an indexing system of barcode sequences using k-mers, and a Bayesian statistical test incorporating a substitution error rate to distinguish true from error sequences.When benchmarking with synthetic data, Shepherd provides barcode count estimates that are significantly more accurate than state-of-the-art methods, producing 10–150 times fewer spurious lineages. For empirical data, Shepherd produces results that are consistent with the improvements seen on synthetic data. These improvements enable higher resolution lineage tracking and more accurate estimates of biologically relevant quantities, e.g. the detection of small effect mutations.A Python implementation of Shepherd is freely available at: https://www.github.com/Nik-Tavakolian/Shepherd.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In the evaluation of individual tools, Homopolish, PEPPER, and Medaka demonstrated better results than others. In combination polishing, the second round Homopolish, and the PEPPER × medaka combination also showed better results than others. However, individual tools and combinations have specific limitations on usage and results. Depending on the target organism and the purpose of the downstream research, it is confirmed that there remain some difficulties in perfectly replacing the hybrid polishing carried out by the addition of a short-read. Nevertheless, through continuous improvement of the protein pores, related base-calling algorithms, and polishing tools based on improved error models, a high-quality microbial genome can be achieved using only Nanopore reads without the production of additional short-read data.

	abstract = {Nanopore sequencing is a powerful single molecule DNA sequencing technology which offers high throughput and long sequence reads. Nevertheless, its high native error rate limits the direct detection of point mutations in individual reads of amplicon libraries, as these mutations are difficult to distinguish from the sequencing noise.
In this work, we developed SINGLe (SNPs In Nanopore reads of Gene Libraries), a computational method to reduce the noise in nanopore reads of amplicons containing point variations. Our approach uses the fact that all reads are very similar to a wild type sequence, for which we experimentally characterize the position-specific systematic sequencing error pattern. We then use this information to reweight the confidence given to nucleotides that do not match the wild type in individual variant reads. We tested this method in a set of variants of KlenTaq, where the true mutation rate was well below the sequencing noise. SINGLe improves between 4 and 9 fold the signal to noise ratio, in comparison to the data returned by the basecaller guppy. Downstream, this approach improves variants clustering and consensus calling.
SINGLe is simple to implement and requires only a few thousands reads of the wild type sequence of interest, which can be easily obtained by multiplexing in a single minION run. It does not require any modification in the experimental protocol, it does not imply a large loss of sequencing throughput, and it can be incorporated downstream of standard basecalling.},

	abstract = {Embryonic stem cells can propagate indefinitely in a pluripotent state, able to differentiate into all types of specialized cells when restored to the embryo. What sustains their pluripotency during propagation remains unclear. Here, we show that core pluripotency factors OCT4 and SOX2 suppress chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective form of autophagy, until the initiation of differentiation. Low CMA activity promotes embryonic stem cell self-renewal, whereas its up-regulation enhances differentiation. CMA degrades isocitrate dehydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 and reduces levels of intracellular α-ketoglutarate, an obligatory cofactor for various histone and DNA demethylases involved in pluripotency. These findings suggest that CMA mediates the effect of core pluripotency factors on metabolism, shaping the epigenetic landscape of stem cells and governing the balance between self-renewal and differentiation.},

	abstract = {Sequence-specific DNA binding by transcription factors (TFs) is a crucial step in gene regulation. However, current high-throughput in vitro approaches cannot reliably detect lower affinity TF-DNA interactions, which play key roles in gene regulation. Here, we developed PADIT-seq ( p rotein a ffinity to D NA by in vitro transcription and RNA seq uencing) to assay TF binding preferences to all 10-bp DNA sequences at far greater sensitivity than prior approaches. The expanded catalogs of low affinity DNA binding sites for the human TFs HOXD13 and EGR1 revealed that nucleotides flanking high affinity DNA binding sites create overlapping lower affinity sites that together modulate TF genomic occupancy in vivo . Formation of such extended recognition sequences stems from an inherent property of TF binding sites to interweave each other and expands the genomic sequence space for identifying noncoding variants that directly alter TF binding.
ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY: Overlapping DNA binding sites underlie TF genomic occupancy through their inherent propensity to interweave each other.},

	abstract = {Random DNA barcodes are a versatile tool for tracking cell lineages, with applications ranging from development to cancer to evolution. Here we review and critically evaluate barcode designs as well as methods of barcode sequencing and initial processing of barcode data. We first demonstrate how various barcode design decisions affect data quality and propose a new optimal design that balances all considerations that we are currently aware of. We then discuss various options for the preparation of barcode sequencing libraries, including inline indices and Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). Our main conclusion is that the utility of inline indices is high whereas that of UMIs is low. Finally, we test the performance of several established and new bioinformatic pipelines for the extraction of barcodes from raw sequencing reads and for error correction. We find that both alignment and regular expression-based approaches work well for barcode extraction, and that error correction pipelines designed specifically for barcode data are superior to generic ones. Overall, this review will help researchers approach their barcoding experiments in a deliberate and systematic way.},

Our results highlight the differential outcome of distinct p53 mutations in human patients and elucidate the selective pressure driving p53 conservation throughout evolution. Furthermore, while loss of anti-proliferative functionality largely correlates with the occurrence of cancer-associated p53 mutations, we observe that selective gain-of-function may further favor particular mutants in vivo. Finally, when combined with additional acquired p53 mutations, seemingly neutral TP53 SNPs may modulate phenotypic outcome and, presumably, tumor progression.},

	abstract = {Three billion years of evolution has produced a tremendous diversity of protein molecules1, but the full potential of proteins is likely to be much greater. Accessing this potential has been challenging for both computation and experiments because the space of possible protein molecules is much larger than the space of those likely to have functions. Here we introduce Chroma, a generative model for proteins and protein complexes that can directly sample novel protein structures and sequences, and that can be conditioned to steer the generative process towards desired properties and functions. To enable this, we introduce a diffusion process that respects the conformational statistics of polymer ensembles, an efficient neural architecture for molecular systems that enables long-range reasoning with sub-quadratic scaling, layers for efficiently synthesizing three-dimensional structures of proteins from predicted inter-residue geometries and a general low-temperature sampling algorithm for diffusion models. Chroma achieves protein design as Bayesian inference under external constraints, which can involve symmetries, substructure, shape, semantics and even natural-language prompts. The experimental characterization of 310 proteins shows that sampling from Chroma results in proteins that are highly expressed, fold and have favourable biophysical properties. The crystal structures of two designed proteins exhibit atomistic agreement with Chroma samples (a backbone root-mean-square deviation of around 1.0 Å). With this unified approach to protein design, we hope to accelerate the programming of protein matter to benefit human health, materials science and synthetic biology.},

	abstract = {, The
tetracycline operon is an important gene network component,
commonly used in synthetic biology applications because of its switch-like
character. At the heart of this system is the highly specific interaction
of the tet repressor protein (TetR) with its cognate DNA sequence
(tetO). TetR binding on tetO practically stops expression of genes
downstream of tetO by excluding RNA polymerase from binding the promoter
and initiating transcription. Mutating the tetO sequence alters the
strength of TetR–tetO binding and thus provides a tool to synthetic
biologists to manipulate gene expression levels. We employ molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with the free energy perturbation
method to investigate the binding affinity of TetR to different tetO
mutants. We also carry out in vivo tests in Escherichia
coli for a series of promoters based on these mutants.
We obtain reasonable agreement between experimental green fluorescent
protein (GFP) repression levels and binding free energy differences
computed from molecular simulations. In all cases, the wild-type tetO
sequence yields the strongest TetR binding, which is observed both
experimentally, in terms of GFP levels, and in simulation, in terms
of free energy changes. Two of the four tetO mutants we tested yield
relatively strong binding, whereas the other two mutants tend to be
significantly weaker. The clustering and relative ranking of this
subset of tetO mutants is generally consistent between our own experimental
data, previous experiments with different systems and the free energy
changes computed from our simulations. Overall, this work offers insights
into an important synthetic biological system and demonstrates the
potential, as well as limitations of molecular simulations to quantitatively
explain biologically relevant behavior.},

To do this, we utilized the overlaps between reads that are a feature of many sequencing libraries. With this method, we surveyed 1943 different datasets from seven different sequencing instruments produced by Illumina. We show that among public datasets, the more expensive platforms like HiSeq and NovaSeq have a lower error rate and less variation. But we also discovered that there is great variation within each platform, with the accuracy of a sequencing experiment depending greatly on the experimenter. We show the importance of sequence context, especially the phenomenon where preceding bases bias the following bases toward the same identity. We also show the difference in patterns of sequence bias between instruments. Contrary to expectations based on the underlying chemistry, HiSeq X Ten and NovaSeq 6000 share notable exceptions to the preceding-base bias. Our results demonstrate the importance of the specific circumstances of every sequencing experiment, and the importance of evaluating the quality of each one.},

	abstract = {Engineered light, oxygen, and voltage (LOV)-based proteins are able to fluoresce without oxygen requirement due to the autocatalytic incorporation of exogenous flavin as a chromophore thus allowing for live cell imaging under hypoxic and anaerobic conditions. They were also discovered to have high sensitivity to transition metal ions and physiological flavin derivatives. These properties make flavin-binding fluorescent proteins (FPs) a perspective platform for biosensor development. However, brightness of currently available flavin-binding FPs is limited compared to GFP-like FPs creating a need for their further enhancement and optimization. In this study, we applied a directed molecular evolution approach to develop a pair of flavin-binding FPs, named miniGFP1 and miniGFP2. The miniGFP proteins are characterized by cyan-green fluorescence with excitation/emission maxima at 450/499 nm and a molecular size of {\textasciitilde}13 kDa. We carried out systematic benchmarking of miniGFPs in Escherichia coli and cultured mammalian cells against spectrally similar FPs including GFP-like FP, bilirubin-binding FP, and bright flavin-binding FPs. The miniGFPs proteins exhibited improved photochemical properties compared to other flavin-binding FPs enabling long-term live cell imaging. We demonstrated the utility of miniGFPs for live cell imaging in bacterial culture under anaerobic conditions and in CHO cells under hypoxia. The miniGFPs’ fluorescence was highly sensitive to Cu(II) ions in solution with Kd values of 67 and 68 nM for miniGFP1 and miniGFP2, respectively. We also observed fluorescence quenching of miniGFPs by the reduced form of Cu(I) suggesting its potential application as an optical indicator for Cu(I) and Cu(II). In addition, miniGFPs showed the ability to selectively bind exogenous flavin mononucleotide demonstrating a potential for utilization as a selective fluorescent flavin indicator. Altogether, miniGFPs can serve as a multisensing platform for fluorescence biosensor development for in vitro and in-cell applications.},

However, variant effect assays have generally been undertaken reactively for individual variants only after and, in most cases long after, their first observation. Now, multiplexed assays of variant effect can characterise massive numbers of variants simultaneously, yielding variant effect maps that reveal the function of every possible single nucleotide change in a gene or regulatory element. Generating maps for every protein encoding gene and regulatory element in the human genome would create an ‘Atlas’ of variant effect maps and transform our understanding of genetics and usher in a new era of nucleotide-resolution functional knowledge of the genome. An Atlas would reveal the fundamental biology of the human genome, inform human evolution, empower the development and use of therapeutics and maximize the utility of genomics for diagnosing and treating disease.

	abstract = {Many genomes contain families of paralogs—proteins with divergent function that evolved from a common ancestral gene after a duplication event. To understand how paralogous transcription factors evolve divergent DNA specificities, we examined how the glucocorticoid receptor and its paralogs evolved to bind activating response elements [(+)GREs] and negative glucocorticoid response elements (nGREs). We show that binding to nGREs is a property of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) DNA-binding domain (DBD) not shared by other members of the steroid receptor family. Using phylogenetic, structural, biochemical, and molecular dynamics techniques, we show that the ancestral DBD from which GR and its paralogs evolved was capable of binding both nGRE and (+)GRE sequences because of the ancestral DBD’s ability to assume multiple DNA-bound conformations. Subsequent amino acid substitutions in duplicated daughter genes selectively restricted protein conformational space, causing this dual DNA-binding specificity to be selectively enhanced in the GR lineage and lost in all others. Key substitutions that determined the receptors’ response element-binding specificity were far from the proteins’ DNA-binding interface and interacted epistatically to change the DBD’s function through DNA-induced allosteric mechanisms. These amino acid substitutions subdivided both the conformational and functional space of the ancestral DBD among the present-day receptors, allowing a paralogous family of transcription factors to control disparate transcriptional programs despite high sequence identity.},

However, it remains unclear how the redundant proteins produced by gene duplication ultimately acquire new interaction specificities to establish insulated paralogous signaling pathways. Here, we used ancestral sequence reconstruction to resurrect and characterize a bacterial two-component signaling system that duplicated in α-proteobacteria. We determined the interaction specificities of the signaling proteins that existed before and immediately after this duplication event and then identified key mutations responsible for establishing specificity in the two systems. Just three mutations, in only two of the four interacting proteins, were sufficient to establish specificity of the extant systems. Some of these mutations weakened interactions between paralogous systems to limit crosstalk. However, others strengthened interactions within a system, indicating that the ancestral interaction, although functional, had the potential to be strengthened. Our work suggests that protein-protein interactions with such latent potential may be highly amenable to duplication and divergence.},

This interface consists of a central hydrophobic region surrounded by several hydrogen bonds.

Despite numerous structural studies and large-scale analyses of HD DNA binding specificity, HD-DNA recognition is still not fully understood. Here, we analyze 92 human HD mutants, including disease-associated variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUS), for their effects on DNA binding activity. Many of the variants alter DNA binding affinity and/or specificity. Detailed biochemical analysis and structural modeling identifies 14 previously unknown specificity-determining positions, 5 of which do not contact DNA. The same missense substitution at analogous positions within different HDs often exhibits different effects on DNA binding activity. Variant effect prediction tools perform moderately well in distinguishing variants with altered DNA binding affinity, but poorly in identifying those with altered binding specificity.

Genetic studies have demonstrated that homeodomain proteins regulate many developmental processes. Yet, biochemical data reveal that most bind highly similar DNA sequences. Defining how homeodomain proteins achieve DNA binding specificity has therefore been a long-standing goal. Here, we developed a novel computational approach to predict cooperative dimeric binding of homeodomain proteins using High-Throughput (HT) SELEX data. Importantly, we found that 15 of 88 homeodomain factors form cooperative homodimer complexes on DNA sites with precise spacing requirements. Approximately one third of the paired-like homeodomain proteins cooperatively bind palindromic sequences spaced 3 bp apart, whereas other homeodomain proteins cooperatively bind sites with distinct orientation and spacing requirements. Combining structural models of a paired-like factor with our cooperativity predictions identified key amino acid differences that help differentiate between cooperative and non-cooperative factors. Finally, we confirmed predicted cooperative dimer sites in vivo using available genomic data for a subset of factors. These findings demonstrate how HT-SELEX data can be computationally mined to predict cooperativity. In addition, the binding site spacing requirements of select homeodomain proteins provide a mechanism by which seemingly similar AT-rich DNA sequences can preferentially recruit specific homeodomain factors.},

 regulate various cellular processes by specifically binding to the
 transcriptional control region of a target gene. These proteins
 have been conserved across a diverse range of species, from yeast
 to human. A number of inherited human disorders are caused by mutations
 in homeodomain-containing proteins. In this study, we present an
 evolutionary classification of 129 human homeodomain proteins. Phylogenetic analysis
 of these proteins, whose sequences were aligned based on the three-dimensional
 structure of the homeodomain, was performed using a distance matrix
 approach. The homeodomain proteins segregate into six distinct classes,
 and this classification is consistent with the known functional
 and structural characteristics of these proteins. An ancestral sequence
 signature that accurately describes the unique sequence characteristics
 of each of these classes has been derived. The phylogenetic analysis, coupled
 with the chromosomal localization of these genes, provides powerful
 clues as to how each of these classes arose from the ancestral homeodomain.},

Here we use ancestral protein reconstruction, biochemical experiments, and developmental assays of transgenic animals carrying reconstructed ancestral genes to investigate how the transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd) evolved its central role in anterior-posterior patterning in flies. We show that most of Bcd’s derived functions are attributable to evolutionary changes within its homeodomain (HD) during a phylogenetic interval {\textgreater}140 million years ago. A single substitution from this period (Q50K) accounts almost entirely for the evolution of Bcd’s derived DNA specificity in vitro. In transgenic embryos expressing the reconstructed ancestral HD, however, Q50K confers activation of only a few of Bcd’s transcriptional targets and yields a very partial rescue of anterior development. Adding a second historical substitution (M54R) confers regulation of additional Bcd targets and further rescues anterior development. These results indicate that two epistatically interacting mutations played a major role in the evolution of Bcd’s controlling regulatory role in early development. They also show how ancestral sequence reconstruction can be combined with in vivo characterization of transgenic animals to illuminate the historical mechanisms of developmental evolution.},

However, relatively little is known about the evolutionary plasticity of transcription factors. For example, the exact functional consequence of an amino acid substitution on the DNA-binding specificity of most transcription factors is currently not predictable. Furthermore, although the major structural families of transcription factors have been identified, the detailed DNA-binding repertoires within most families have not been characterized. We studied the sequence recognition code and evolvability of the basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor family by creating all possible 95 single-point mutations of five DNA-contacting residues of Max, a human helix–loop–helix transcription factor and measured the detailed DNA-binding repertoire of each mutant. Our results show that the sequence-specific repertoire of Max accessible through single-point mutations is extremely limited, and we are able to predict 92\% of the naturally occurring diversity at these positions. All naturally occurring basic regions were also found to be accessible through functional intermediates. Finally, we observed a set of amino acids that are functional in vitro but are not found to be used naturally, indicating that functionality alone is not sufficient for selection.},

	abstract = {Background
Human hemoglobin is an allosteric protein that exerts exquisite control over ligand binding through large-scale conformational changes. The two-state model without intermediates offers a simple qualitative description of the allosteric behavior of hemoglobin, as presented in textbooks. However, there is renewed interest in this topic due to recent experimental breakthroughs that show how hemoglobin actually undergoes conformational transitions in response to environmental changes.
Scope of review
I review the current understanding of hemoglobin structure-function relationships revealed by recent discoveries. A unique single crystal, in which three protein molecules are allowed to express a whole range of quaternary structures, helped to reveal the detailed transition pathway including various intermediate forms. I also discuss the potential of single-molecule techniques that are currently under examination.
Major conclusions
New crystallographic approaches reveal that the hemoglobin allosteric transition involves population shifts in multiple quaternary conformers rather than a simple two-state switch, and that coexisting individual conformers may have disproportionate effects on the apparent O2 affinity of hemoglobin.
General significance
These approaches provide a further level of complexity on the textbook statement of hemoglobin allostery, highlighting the relevance of conformational distributions in controlling the function and regulation of allosteric proteins.},

TtgR and the TtgB efflux pump proteins possess multidrug-binding capacity, and their concerted action is responsible for the multidrug resistance phenotype of Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E. TtgR binds to a pseudo-palindromic site that overlaps the ttgR/ttgA promoters. Dimethylsulfate footprint assays reveal a close interaction between TtgR and the central region of this operator. The results of analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrate that TtgR forms stable dimers in solution, and that two dimers bind to the operator. Microcalorimetric analysis of the binding of the two TtgR dimers to the cognate operator showed biphasic behavior, and an interaction model was developed for the cooperative binding of two TtgR dimers to their target operators. The binding of the two TtgR dimers to the operator was characterized by a Hill coefficient of 1.63±0.13 (kD=18.2(±6.3) μM, kD′=0.91(±0.49) μM), indicating positive cooperativity. These data are in close agreement with the results of sedimentation equilibrium studies of TtgR–DNA complexes. A series of oligonucleotides were generated in which the imperfect palindrome of the TtgR operator was empirically optimized. Optimization of the palindrome did not significantly alter the binding of the initial TtgR dimer to the operator, but increased the cooperativity of binding and consequently the overall affinity. The minimal fragment for TtgR binding was a 30-mer DNA duplex, and analysis of its sequence revealed two partially overlapping inverted repeats co-existing within the large pseudo-palindrome operator. Based on the architecture of the operator, the thermodynamics of the process, and the TtgR–operator interactions we propose a model for the binding of TtgR to its target sequence.},

	abstract = {Mutation is a critical mechanism by which evolution explores the functional landscape of proteins. Despite our ability to experimentally inflict mutations at will, it remains difficult to link sequence-level perturbations to systems-level responses. Here, we present a framework centered on measuring changes in the free energy of the system to link individual mutations in an allosteric transcriptional repressor to the parameters which govern its response. We find that the energetic effects of the mutations can be categorized into several classes which have characteristic curves as a function of the inducer concentration. We experimentally test these diagnostic predictions using the well-characterized LacI repressor of Escherichia coli, probing several mutations in the DNA binding and inducer binding domains. We find that the change in gene expression due to a point mutation can be captured by modifying only the model parameters that describe the respective domain of the wild-type protein. These parameters appear to be insulated, with mutations in the DNA binding domain altering only the DNA affinity and those in the inducer binding domain altering only the allosteric parameters. Changing these subsets of parameters tunes the free energy of the system in a way that is concordant with theoretical expectations. Finally, we show that the induction profiles and resulting free energies associated with pairwise double mutants can be predicted with quantitative accuracy given knowledge of the single mutants, providing an avenue for identifying and quantifying epistatic interactions.},

	abstract = {Many events in the viral life cycle involve protein binding to defined sequences on the viral chromosome. Chromatin immunoprecipitation allows the detection of the in vivo interaction of specific proteins with specific genomic regions. In this technique, living cells are treated with formaldehyde to crosslink neighboring protein-protein and protein-DNA molecules. The crosslink with formaldehyde is reversible and covers a short distance (2 A); the components that are crosslinked are therefore in close proximity. Nuclear fractions are isolated, and the genomic DNA is sheared to reduce the average DNA fragment size to around 500 bp. These nuclear lysates are used in immunoprecipitations with an antibody against the protein of interest. The DNA bound to the studied protein is enriched after the immunoprecipitation. After reversal of the crosslinking, the resulting DNA and proteins can be independently studied. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay provides a rapid method to study DNA-binding protein interactions in vitro. This assay is based on the observation that complexes of protein and DNA migrate through a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel more slowly than free DNA fragments. The assay is performed by incubating a purified protein, or a complex mixture of proteins, with a 32P end-labeled DNA probe containing the protein-binding site. The reaction products are analyzed on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The specificity of the DNA-binding protein for the putative binding site is established by competition experiments using specific and nonspecific nonradiolabeled DNA probes. The components of the complexes can be identified with antibodies to the protein of interest.},

Of particular interest are transcription factors (TFs), which through their sequence-specific interactions with DNA binding sites, modulate gene expression in a manner required for normal cellular growth and differentiation, and also for response to environmental stimuli. Despite their importance, the DNA binding specificities of most DNA binding proteins still remain unknown, since prior technologies aimed at identifying DNA-protein interactions have been laborious, not highly scalable, or have required limiting biological reagents. Recently a new DNA microarray-based technology, termed protein binding microarrays (PBMs), has been developed that allows rapid, high-throughput characterization of the in vitro DNA binding site sequence specificities of TFs, other DNA binding proteins or synthetic compounds. DNA binding site data from PBMs combined with gene annotation data, comparative sequence analysis, and gene expression profiling, can be used to predict what genes are regulated by a given TF, what the functions are of a given TF and its predicted target genes, and how that TF may fit into the cell’s transcriptional regulatory network.},

	abstract = {Bacteria that associate with living hosts require intricate mechanisms to detect and respond to host defenses. Part of the early host defense against invading bacteria is the production of reactive oxygen species, and xanthine oxidase is one of the main producers of such agents. The end-product of the enzymatic activity of xanthine oxidase, urate, was previously shown to be the natural ligand for Deinococcus radiodurans-encoded HucR and it was shown to attenuate DNA binding by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-encoded PecS and Burkholderia thailandensis-encoded MftR, all members of the multiple antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) family. We here show that residues involved in binding urate and eliciting the DNA binding antagonism are conserved in a specific subset of MarR homologs. Although HucR controls endogenous urate levels by regulating a uricase gene, almost all other homologs are predicted to respond to exogenous urate levels and to regulate a transmembrane transport protein belonging to either the drug metabolite transporter (DMT) or the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), as further evidenced by the presence of conserved binding sites for the cognate transcription factor within the respective promoter regions. These data suggest the use of orthologous genes for different regulatory purposes. We propose the designation UrtR (urate responsive transcriptional regulator) for this distinct subfamily of MarR homologs based on their common mechanism of urate-mediated attenuation of DNA binding.},

	abstract = {The multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) operon of Escherichia coli is a paradigm for chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance in enteric bacteria. The locus is recognised for its ability to modulate efflux pump and porin expression via two encoded transcription factors, MarR and MarA. Here we map binding of these regulators across the E. coli genome and identify an extensive mar regulon. Most notably, MarA activates expression of genes required for DNA repair and lipid trafficking. Consequently, the mar locus reduces quinolone-induced DNA damage and the ability of tetracyclines to traverse the outer membrane. These previously unrecognised mar pathways reside within a core regulon, shared by most enteric bacteria. Hence, we provide a framework for understanding multidrug resistance, mediated by analogous systems, across the Enterobacteriaceae. Transcription factors MarR and MarA confer multidrug resistance in enteric bacteria by modulating efflux pump and porin expression. Here, Sharma et al. show that MarA also upregulates genes required for lipid trafficking and DNA repair, thus reducing antibiotic entry and quinolone-induced DNA damage.},

A synthetic library of Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) with ∼1012 individual members was generated using click display in a 25-μl reaction and six rounds of library panning against a model protein yielded a panel of nanomolar binders.

This model predicts the influence of proposed mutations on protein structure and function, quantifying the feasibility of each mutation for rescuing hybrid repressors. We accurately predict which hybrid repressors can be rescued by mutating residues to reinstall relevant module-module interactions. Experimental results confirm that dynamic ranges of gene expression induction were improved significantly in these mutants.

In this work, we test this idea by characterizing repression in vivo and the binding of RNA polymerase in vitro in experiments where operators of various sequences were placed either upstream or downstream from the promoter in Escherichia coli. Surprisingly, we find that operators with a weaker binding affinity can yield higher repression levels than stronger operators. Repressor bound to upstream operators modulates promoter escape, and the magnitude of this modulation is not correlated with the repressor-operator binding affinity. This suggests that operator sequences may modulate transcription by altering the nature of the interaction of the bound transcription factor with the transcriptional machinery, implying a new layer of sequence dependence that must be confronted in the quantitative understanding of gene expression.},

	abstract = {Reciprocal gene activation and restriction during cell type differentiation from a common lineage is a hallmark of mammalian organogenesis. A key question, then, is whether a critical transcriptional activator of cell type–specific gene targets can also restrict expression of the same genes in other cell types. Here, we show that whereas the pituitary-specific POU domain factor Pit-1 activates growth hormone gene expression in one cell type, the somatotrope, it restricts its expression from a second cell type, the lactotrope. This distinction depends on a two–base pair spacing in accommodation of the bipartite POU domains on a conserved growth hormone promoter site. The allosteric effect on Pit-1, in combination with other DNA binding factors, results in the recruitment of a corepressor complex, including nuclear receptor corepressor N-CoR, which, unexpectedly, is required for active long-term repression of the growth hormone gene in lactotropes.},

Extensive efforts have been made to purify in vivo-assembled RNA–protein complexes. In this review, we focused on commonly used RNA-centric approaches that involve mass spectrometry, which are powerful tools for identifying proteins bound to a given RNA. We present various RNA capture strategies that primarily depend on whether the RNA of interest is modified. Moreover, we briefly discuss the advantages and limitations of in vitro and in vivo approaches. Furthermore, we describe recent advances in quantitative proteomics as well as the methods that are most commonly used to validate robust mass spectrometry data.

	abstract = {While great advances in predicting the effects of coding variants have been made, the assessment of non-coding variants remains challenging. This is especially problematic for variants within promoter regions which can lead to over-expression of a gene or reduce or even abolish its expression. The binding of transcription factors to the DNA can be predicted using position weight matrices (PWMs). More recently, transcription factor flexible models (TFFMs) have been introduced and shown to be more accurate than PWMs. TFFMs are based on hidden Markov models and can account for complex positional dependencies. Our new web-based application FABIAN-variant uses 1224 TFFMs and 3790 PWMs to predict whether and to which degree DNA variants affect the binding of 1387 different human transcription factors. For each variant and transcription factor, the software combines the results of different models for a final prediction of the resulting binding-affinity change. The software is written in C++ for speed but variants can be entered through a web interface. Alternatively, a VCF file can be uploaded to assess variants identified by high-throughput sequencing. The search can be restricted to variants in the vicinity of candidate genes. FABIAN-variant is available freely at https://www.genecascade.org/fabian/.},

Together, these approaches have greatly expanded our understanding of TF–DNA interactions. However, the mechanisms by which TFs select in vivo binding sites and alter gene expression remain unclear.

The first question relates to binding at different sites; the second relates to binding at similar sites. These questions apply to transcription factors binding to genomic DNA and to protein interaction domains binding to their partners. Here, we explain that both can be understood in terms of allostery and the cellular (or in vitro) environment. The idea is simple yet powerful; it emphasizes the role of allostery in defining whether binding between transcription factors and (cognate or noncognate) DNA sequences will lead to function and to the type of function. Allosteric effects are the outcome of dynamically shifting populations; thus binding to even slightly different DNA sequences will lead to different transcription factor conformations that can be reflected in the binding sites to their co-regulators. Currently, allostery is not considered when trying to understand how binding phenomena determine the functional outcome. Allosteric effects can enhance the binding specificity in a function-oriented manner. Here we provide a biological rationale that considers cellular crowding effects.},

Altogether, the JASPAR 2024 update provides a 20\% increase in CORE profiles from the previous release. A trimming algorithm enhanced profiles by removing low information content flanking base pairs, which were likely uninformative (within the capacity of the PFM models) for TFBS predictions and modelling TF-DNA interactions. This release includes enhanced metadata, featuring a refined classification for plant TFs’ structural DNA-binding domains.

	abstract = {Patterns of phyllosphere diversity have become increasingly clear with high-throughput sequencing surveys, but the processes that control phyllosphere diversity are still emerging. Through a combination of lab and field experiments using Napa cabbage and lactic acid bacteria (LAB), we examined how dispersal and establishment processes shape the ecological distributions of phyllosphere bacteria. We first determined the abundance and diversity of LAB on Napa cabbage grown at three sites using both culture-based approaches and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Across all sites, LAB made up less than 0.9\% of the total bacterial community abundance. To assess whether LAB were low in abundance in the Napa cabbage phyllosphere due to a limited abundance in local species pools (source limitation), we quantified LAB in leaf and soil samples across 51 vegetable farms and gardens throughout the northeastern United States. Across all sites, LAB comprised less than 3.2\% of the soil bacterial communities and less than 1.6\% of phyllosphere bacterial communities. To assess whether LAB are unable to grow in the phyllosphere even if they dispersed at high rates (establishment limitation), we used a gnotobiotic Napa cabbage system in the lab with experimental communities mimicking various dispersal rates of LAB. Even at high dispersal rates, LAB became rare or completely undetectable in experimental communities, suggesting that they are also establishment limited. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the low abundance of LAB in phyllosphere communities may be explained by establishment limitation.IMPORTANCE The quality and safety of vegetable fermentations are dependent on the activities of LAB naturally present in the phyllosphere. Despite their critical role in determining the success of fermentation, the processes that determine the abundance and diversity of LAB in vegetables used for fermentation are poorly characterized. Our work demonstrates that the limited ability of LAB to grow in the cabbage phyllosphere environment may constrain their abundance on cabbage leaves. These results suggest that commercial fermentation of Napa cabbage proceeds despite low and variable abundances of LAB across different growing regions. Propagule limitation may also explain ecological distributions of other rare members of phyllosphere microbes.},
