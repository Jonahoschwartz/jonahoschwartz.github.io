Hello! My name is Jonah (He/Him), and I am a graduate student in the [Raman Lab](https://www.ramanlaboratory.org/) at UW–Madison. I am part of the [Integrated Program in Biochemistry at UW–Madison](https://ipib.wisc.edu/), where I use high-throughput methods to study allostery in transcription factors.

Prior to graduate school, I worked in the lab of Ben Wolfe at Tufts University, studying the dynamics of lactic acid bacteria in the sauerkraut microbiome. After that, I spent time at the Broad Institute’s Genetic Perturbation Platform, developing production schemes for genetic perturbation reagents, and at Ginkgo Bioworks as a protein engineer.

Outside of lab I love to bike, fish, and make things (pottery, ceramics, bikes)
